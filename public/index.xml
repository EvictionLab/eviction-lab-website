      <description>Today, the majority of poor renting families in America spend over half of their income on housing costs, and eviction is transforming their lives. Yet little is known about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of housing insecurity.
The Eviction Lab is a team of researchers, students, and website architects who believe that a stable, affordable home is central to human flourishing and economic mobility.</description>

      <description>Matthew Desmond started studying housing, poverty, and eviction in 2008, living and working alongside poor tenants and their landlords in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Combining ethnographic fieldwork with original statistical analyses, Desmond discovered that eviction was incredibly prevalent in low-income communities and functioned as a cause, not just a condition, of poverty. This work was summarized in his book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City (2016).</description>

      <description>Through this website, the Eviction Lab has made nationwide eviction data publicly available and accessible. We hope this data is used by policymakers, community organizers, journalists, educators, non-profit organizations, students, and citizens interested in understanding more about housing, eviction, and poverty in their own backyards. You can look at evictions over time, map evictions in the United States, compare the eviction rates of different neighborhoods, cities, or states, and generate custom reports about America’s eviction epidemic.</description>

      <description>The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from 48 states and the District of Columbia. Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant and plaintiff names, the defendant’s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. We combined these records with demographic information from the Census to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening.</description>

      <description>No. Evictions can happen outside of the courtroom, as when landlords pay renters to leave or execute illegal lockouts. There is some evidence that “informal evictions” are more common than “formal”, court-ordered evictions. Informal evictions are not captured in our dataset. Moreover, while we have tried to collect every recorded court-ordered eviction case, going back to 2000, some records were unavailable.</description>

      <description>On the map, we have indicated with the symbol Census tracts and block groups with filing and eviction rates in the top 1%. There are areas with high rates because housing insecurity is especially acute there. But there are other considerations as well.

      <description>A “filing rate” is the ratio of the number of evictions filed in an area over the number of renter-occupied homes in that area. An “eviction rate” is the subset of those homes that received an eviction judgement in which renters were ordered to leave. The filing rate also counts all eviction cases filed in an area, including multiple cases filed against the same address in the same year.</description>

      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property. An eviction is a judgment from the court that a tenant should be removed. As not every eviction filing results in an eviction, the filing rate will always be higher in a given area than the eviction rate.</description>

      <description>While other units of geography are all connected (block groups, census tracts, counties, etc.), place boundaries are separate—requiring evictions to be aggregated and estimated differently. In many cases, the estimates of eviction are non-whole numbers (e.g., 0.4, 31.5, 100.6).
One feature of this strategy is that some low population areas could have less than one eviction estimated for that place.</description>

      <description>Because these data were collected manually from courts across the country, some areas are missing data over time. In other cases, statistical models indicated that there was too much variance in collection from one year to the next. In these cases, we filled in some of those gaps by “imputing” data based on a set of procedures listed in our Methodology Report (PDF).</description>

      <description>Eviction records contain addresses. We had these addresses geocoded and spatially joined by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). This process allowed us to match each address record to a latitude and a longitude. Then, by overlaying the geographic boundaries on top of these points, we can observe how many evictions took place in that area.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q200-what-is-eviction/</guid>
      <description>An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters, whereas foreclosures are involuntary moves that happen to homeowners when a bank or other lending agency repossesses a home.
In our data, an eviction is defined as an eviction judgment issued to a renting home.</description>

      <description>An eviction rate is the number of evictions per 100 renter homes in an area. An eviction rate of 5% means that 5 of every 100 renter homes faced eviction in the selected area that year.
Information on the number of renter homes in an area comes from the U.S. Census and ESRI Business Analyst demographic estimates.</description>

      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property.
Within our data, case information is recorded as separate actions with dates of each action. Our estimate of eviction filings is the total amount of cases each year with a first recorded action in that year.</description>

      <description>Since eviction records do not include demographic information like age or gender, we do not have direct access to these numbers. However, local studies show that households with children are especially vulnerable to forced displacement. While we don&amp;rsquo;t have the full picture now, the Eviction Lab dataset enables users to create estimates on a scale that was previously impossible, and important questions like these can be addressed in future research.</description>

      <description>Join the Urban Institute for a discussion about a new data source on evictions in the US and its value for community response.
A shortage of affordable rental housing leaves millions of US households struggling to pay rent and avoid eviction. As documented by the sociologist and ethnographer Matthew Desmond and other housing scholars, evictions destabilize renters’ current housing and affect their work, health, education, and future housing options.</description>

      <description>NPR&amp;rsquo;s Marketplace features an interview between host David Brancaccio and Matthew Desmond, detailing the shocking volume of evictions in the US, their deeper causes, and how the hotspots of the eviction crisis are often places you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect.
Desmond: &amp;ldquo;If you read the news, you&amp;rsquo;d think that the housing crisis is basically in Seattle, and New York City, and San Francisco.</description>

      <description>The New York Times has chosen Richmond, VA (listed at #2 in our Eviction Rankings) as the focus of a front-page story, which also profiles Matthew Desmond and The Eviction Lab&amp;rsquo;s work in collecting over 83 million eviction records from across the country.
The article details the &amp;ldquo;churning machine&amp;rdquo; of evictions in Richmond, driven by a court system that is often as inscrutable to tenants as it is unsparingly efficient in rendering judgments.</description>

      <description>Imagine if we didn’t know how many Americans were incarcerated each year or how many dropped out of high school, got divorced, or lost their job. If we don’t know how big a problem something is, where it is happening, or how many families are touched by it, then how can we begin the critical work of finding solutions?</description>

      <description>In recent years, renters’ housing costs have far outpaced their incomes, driving a nationwide affordability crisis. Current data from the American Housing Survey show that most poor renting families spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing costs. Under these conditions, 1 millions of Americans today are at risk of losing their homes through eviction.</description>
