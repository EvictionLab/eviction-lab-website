Desmond, on the estimate that 2.3 million people faced eviction in 2016:
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s twice the number of Americans that die in car accidents every day. That&amp;rsquo;s twice the number of people who get arrested for drug offenses every year.</description>

      <description>The New York Times has chosen Richmond, VA (listed at #2 in our Eviction Rankings) as the focus of a front-page story, which also profiles Matthew Desmond and The Eviction Lab&amp;rsquo;s work in collecting over 83 million eviction records from across the country.
The article details the &amp;ldquo;churning machine&amp;rdquo; of evictions in Richmond, driven by a court system that is often as inscrutable to tenants as it is unsparingly efficient in rendering judgments.</description>
