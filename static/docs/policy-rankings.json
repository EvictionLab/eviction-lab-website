Newsom issued an order that extended the summons period by 60 day and prohibited eviction enforcement against tenants who were being evicted for non-payment of rent and who could document an impact from COVID-19 (including layoff, wage loss; not able to work due to COVID-19 illness in self or household member or lack of childcare due to school closure). This order was in effect through 05/31/20. On 04/04/20, effective 04/06/20, the California Judicial Council announced several emergency rules, one of which prohibited courts from issuing summonses, defaults, or default judgments in any unlawful detainer case unless necessary to protect health and safety. This rule also required courts to set trial dates in open cases no earlier than 60 days from the landlord’s request for trial, unless an earlier trial date was found necessary to protect health and safety. This rule remained in effect thru 9/1/20, with a replacement from Judicial Council in an order memorandum issued on 08/13/20. On 08/31/20, The California legislature passed emergency legislation that prohibited issuance of a summons in an unlawful detainer action for non-payment of rent until 10/5/20. From 10/05/20 to 01/31/20, the legislation provides that the landlord must have provided the tenant a 15-day notice prior to filing for eviction that the tenant may be eligible for protections if they've suffered an impact from COVID-19. If a tenant's rental debt accrued between 03/01/20-08/31/20, then return of a signed notice prohibits the landlord from filing for eviction on the basis of that debt. If a tenant's rental debt accrues between 09/01/20 and 01/31/21, the return of a signed notice prohibits the landlord from filing for eviction so long as the tenant pays at least 25% of the total rental debt for this period by 1/31/2021. On 1/29/21, the governor signed legislation that states, beginning 7/1/21, tenants who have not paid at least 25% of the total rental debt accrued from 9/1/20 and 6/30/21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be evicted. The 25% payment requirement can take the form of a 25% of monthly rent payment between September 1, 2020 through June 30th, 2021, or a lump sum payment by June 30, 2021 that brings the total paid to 25 percent of what is due over the period covered., plcstandoutbool: 1, until: June 30, 2021 (end of study period), intwtxp: exec order, plcnoticebool: 0, plcnoticetext: Landlords in California could still give notice of eviction to tenants., plccofilbool: 1, plccofiltext: A law in California required that landlords deliver a form asking about financial distress due to COVID-19 to tenants who are behind on rent.

          "$t": "On 03/27/20, Gov. Newsom issued an order that extended the summons period by 60 day and prohibited eviction enforcement against tenants who were being evicted for non-payment of rent and who could document an impact from COVID-19 (including layoff, wage loss; not able to work due to COVID-19 illness in self or household member or lack of childcare due to school closure). This order was in effect through 05/31/20. On 04/04/20, effective 04/06/20, the California Judicial Council announced several emergency rules, one of which prohibited courts from issuing summonses, defaults, or default judgments in any unlawful detainer case unless necessary to protect health and safety. This rule also required courts to set trial dates in open cases no earlier than 60 days from the landlord’s request for trial, unless an earlier trial date was found necessary to protect health and safety. This rule remained in effect thru 9/1/20, with a replacement from Judicial Council in an order memorandum issued on 08/13/20. On 08/31/20, The California legislature passed emergency legislation that prohibited issuance of a summons in an unlawful detainer action for non-payment of rent until 10/5/20. From 10/05/20 to 01/31/20, the legislation provides that the landlord must have provided the tenant a 15-day notice prior to filing for eviction that the tenant may be eligible for protections if they've suffered an impact from COVID-19. If a tenant's rental debt accrued between 03/01/20-08/31/20, then return of a signed notice prohibits the landlord from filing for eviction on the basis of that debt. If a tenant's rental debt accrues between 09/01/20 and 01/31/21, the return of a signed notice prohibits the landlord from filing for eviction so long as the tenant pays at least 25% of the total rental debt for this period by 1/31/2021. On 1/29/21, the governor signed legislation that states, beginning 7/1/21, tenants who have not paid at least 25% of the total rental debt accrued from 9/1/20 and 6/30/21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be evicted. The 25% payment requirement can take the form of a 25% of monthly rent payment between September 1, 2020 through June 30th, 2021, or a lump sum payment by June 30, 2021 that brings the total paid to 25 percent of what is due over the period covered."

On 05/29/20, Gov. Polis limited these protections to tenants who had been unable to pay rent due to an financial hardship due to COVID-19. This order also encourages jurisdictions to lift restrictions on household occupancy and hotel stay limits. The protections of the 05/29 order were set to and did expire 15 days later, on 06/13/20. On 10/15/20, Gov. Polis required that landlords provide tenants with 30 days notice on any rent default that occurred on or after 3/10/20 before filing an eviction. The order also required a landlord serve a tenant with a CDC declaration form before filing for eviction. On 10/21/20, Gov. Polis reinstated an eviction moratorium for those who could prove COVID-19 impact (using CDC declaration language) for 30 days. That order was extended on 11/19/20.

          "$t": "On 04/30/20, Gov. Polis issued an order that prohibited landlords from filing or initiating eviction becase of a tenant's default of any contractual obligation. The order also prohibited the removal/exclusion of a tenant and the execution or enforcement of a writ of possession, except where the tenant posed an imminent and serious threat to another individual or significant damage to property. On 05/29/20, Gov. Polis limited these protections to tenants who had been unable to pay rent due to an financial hardship due to COVID-19. This order also encourages jurisdictions to lift restrictions on household occupancy and hotel stay limits. The protections of the 05/29 order were set to and did expire 15 days later, on 06/13/20. On 10/15/20, Gov. Polis required that landlords provide tenants with 30 days notice on any rent default that occurred on or after 3/10/20 before filing an eviction. The order also required a landlord serve a tenant with a CDC declaration form before filing for eviction. On 10/21/20, Gov. Polis reinstated an eviction moratorium for those who could prove COVID-19 impact (using CDC declaration language) for 30 days. That order was extended on 11/19/20. On 12/18/20, the order extended the definition of COVID-19 hardship to a person who \"at any time after 3/10/20\" met the criteria. The moratorium expired on 12/31/20."

On 4/23/20, the Governor added a prohibition on the commencement (notice and filing pursuant to cited statute) of residential evictions unless the tenant posed a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants, an immediate and severe risk to property, or a violation of any applicable building code, health ordinance (The 04/23/20 order did not supersede the 03/20/20 order). On 04/30/20, the prohibition on enforcement and commencement of residential evictions were combined into one order and extended through 05/29/20. The governor continued to reissue and extend the prohibition on enforcement and commencement with subsequent executive orders. On 11/13/20, the Governor limited the commencement moratorium to those \"covered persons\" who provided landlords with a declaration that they had been impacted by COVID-19 (\"covered persons\" are defined with the some of the language as the CDC moratorium but also require nonpayment due to COVID-19 hardship); the ban on enforcement of residential evictions continued unchanged. By limiting protections to \"covered persons,\" the 11/13/20 order excluded both \"no cause\" terminations and terminations for lease violations that do not fall within the emergency exception. On 12/11/20, the Governor amended and revised the order to clarify that a tenant who does not owe rent is not required to provide a declaration, and landlords cannot commence an eviction against a tenant who does not owe rent unless they pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property . On 01/08/21, this order was reissued and extended through 02/06/21. On 02/05/21, Gov. Pritzker extended the order through 03/06/21.

On 4/23/20, the Governor added a prohibition on the commencement (notice and filing pursuant to cited statute) of residential evictions unless the tenant posed a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants, an immediate and severe risk to property, or a violation of any applicable building code, health ordinance (The 04/23/20 order did not supersede the 03/20/20 order). On 04/30/20, the prohibition on enforcement and commencement of residential evictions were combined into one order and extended through 05/29/20. The governor continued to reissue and extend the prohibition on enforcement and commencement with subsequent executive orders. On 11/13/20, the Governor limited the commencement moratorium to those \"covered persons\" who provided landlords with a declaration that they had been impacted by COVID-19 (\"covered persons\" are defined with the some of the language as the CDC moratorium but also require nonpayment due to COVID-19 hardship); the ban on enforcement of residential evictions continued unchanged. By limiting protections to \"covered persons,\" the 11/13/20 order excluded both \"no cause\" terminations and terminations for lease violations that do not fall within the emergency exception. On 12/11/20, the Governor amended and revised the order to clarify that a tenant who does not owe rent is not required to provide a declaration, and landlords cannot commence an eviction against a tenant who does not owe rent unless they pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property . On 01/08/21, this order was reissued and extended through 02/06/21. On 02/05/21, Gov. Pritzker extended the order through 03/06/21. On 03/05/21, the Governor reissued the order and prohibited continuation of eviction actions against covered persons. On 05/28/21, Gov. Pritzker extended the moratorium through 06/26/21."

On 03/23/20, effective 03/24/20 at 5pm, Gov. Walz announced a moratorium on filing, termination of leases, and enforcement of evictions, excepting evictions where the tenant endangered residents or conducts illegal activity on the property as included in code. On 06/05/20, Gov. Walz revised the moratorium to include an exception where a tenant violated the lease by endangering non-residents. On 07/14/20, effective 08/04/20 at 12:00 am. the Governor issued an executive order that created a ban on filings and also created further exceptions for when a tenant held over after a property owner gave a notice to vacate because the property owner planned to occupy the property. This order also allowed sheriffs to enforce writs of eviction issued before the Governor's 03/23 order went into effect on 3/24/20 at 5pm. On 01/13/21, Gov. Walz extended the peacetime emergency, and with it the eviction moratorium, through 02/12/21. On 05/14/21, the Governor extended the moratorium through 06/14/21."

Essential housing matters included landlord lockout, serious code violation or repair order, and post-eviction relief. On 06/18/20, the Judge announced, effective 06/20/20, that courts would again begin accepting eviction filings and required that a notice informing tenants that they may be eligible for time extension be included. The order also provided that eviction cases commenced prior to or on 3/16/20 would be eligible for virtual settlement. On 08/12/20, the Chief Administrative Judge announced that cases filed before 3/17/20 could commence and enforcement of evictions would re-commence on 10/01/20.

This order has been extended several times and is currently extended until 06/16/21.

On 04/01/20, the PA Supreme Court issued an order that extended its earlier order and clarified that \"the intent of this provision is that, in view of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, during this timeframe no officer, official, or other person employed by the Pennsylvania Judiciary at any level shall effectuate an eviction, ejectment, or other displacement from a residence based upon the failure to make a monetary payment.\" On 04/28/20, after one further extensions, the high court announced that this moratorium was set to end on 05/11/20. On 05/07/20, Gov. Wolf announced that, effective 05/11/20, the statute requiring notice before filing for eviction would be suspended for 60 days until 7/10/20. On 05/21/20, the Governor issued an order that limited the moratorium to evictions for non-payment of rent or exceeding the lease. On 07/09/20, commencing 7/10/20, Gov. Wolfe extended this order until 08/31/20. In a section explaining the scope of the order, the Governor stated that \"The provisions of this Order and the suspension of the Acts under this Order apply only to matters involving the nonpayment of monies as well as to those proceedings related to removal of any tenant solely because the tenant has held over or exceeded the term of a lease.\""

On 03/27/20 and again on 04/22/20, the high court extended the judicial emergency; these orders stated specifically that writs of eviction should be continued. On 05/06/20, the Supreme Court issued a new order, effective 05/18/20, that no longer stated that writs of eviction should be continued; this order was extended to 06/28/20 by order on 06/01/20. On 06/07/20, Gov. Northam requested that the Supreme Court again issue an eviction moratorium for 21 days. On 06/08/20, the Supreme Court issued an order prohibiting issuance of writs of evictions effective 06/08/20 and continuing through 06/28/20. That order expired without an extension. On 07/24/20, Gov. Northam again requested that the Supreme Court issue an eviction moratorium. On 08/07/20, the Supreme Court issued an order prohibiting issuance of writs of eviction for failure to pay rent effective 08/10/20 through 09/07/20. On 11/18/2020, Gov. Northam signed a bill that provided that requires landlords who own more than four units to offer tenants payment plans if they fall behind on rent. If a tenant fails to pay rent (for owners with fewer than 4 units) or fails to pay on a payment plan (for owners with 4 or more units), the landlord must provide the tenant with notice of the availability of rent relief, and if the tenant cooperates in filing a rent relief application, the landlord cannot file for eviction for 45 days while the application is pending.
