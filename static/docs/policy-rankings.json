This order was in effect through 05/31/20. On 04/04/20, effective 04/06/20, the California Judicial Council announced several emergency rules, one of which prohibited courts from issuing summonses, defaults, or default judgments in any unlawful detainer case unless necessary to protect health and safety.

The 25% payment requirement can take the form of a 25% of monthly rent payment between September 1, 2020 through June 30th, 2021, or a lump sum payment by June 30, 2021 that brings the total paid to 25 percent of what is due over the period covered., plcstandoutbool: 1, until: June 30, 2021 (end of study period), intwtxp: exec order, plcnoticebool: 0, plcnoticetext: Landlords in California could still give notice of eviction to tenants., plccofilbool: 1, plccofiltext: A law in California required that landlords deliver a form asking about financial distress due to COVID-19 to tenants who are behind on rent.

Pritzker issued an order, effective 03/21/20 at 5 PM, prohibiting enforcement of residential evictions for the duration of the disaster proclamation. On 4/23/20, the Governor added a prohibition on the commencement (notice and filing pursuant to cited statute) of residential evictions unless the tenant posed a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants, an immediate and severe risk to property, or a violation of any applicable building code, health ordinance (The 04/23/20 order did not supersede the 03/20/20 order). On 04/30/20, the prohibition on enforcement and commencement of residential evictions were combined into one order and extended through 05/29/20. The governor continued to reissue and extend the prohibition on enforcement and commencement with subsequent executive orders. On 11/13/20, the Governor limited the commencement moratorium to those \"covered persons\" who provided landlords with a declaration that they had been impacted by COVID-19 (\"covered persons\" are defined with the some of the language as the CDC moratorium but also require nonpayment due to COVID-19 hardship); the ban on enforcement of residential evictions continued unchanged. By limiting protections to \"covered persons,\" the 11/13/20 order excluded both \"no cause\" terminations and terminations for lease violations that do not fall within the emergency exception. On 12/11/20, the Governor amended and revised the order to clarify that a tenant who does not owe rent is not required to provide a declaration, and landlords cannot commence an eviction against a tenant who does not owe rent unless they pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property . On 01/08/21, this order was reissued and extended through 02/06/21. On 02/05/21, Gov. Pritzker extended the order through 03/06/21. On 03/05/21, the Governor reissued the order and prohibited continuation of eviction actions against covered persons. On 05/28/21, Gov.

03/20/20, Gov. Pritzker issued an order, effective 03/21/20 at 5 PM, prohibiting enforcement of residential evictions for the duration of the disaster proclamation.

On 04/30/20, the prohibition on enforcement and commencement of residential evictions were combined into one order and extended through 05/29/20. The governor continued to reissue and extend the prohibition on enforcement and commencement with subsequent executive orders. On 11/13/20, the Governor limited the commencement moratorium to those \"covered persons\" who provided landlords with a declaration that they had been impacted by COVID-19 (\"covered persons\" are defined with the some of the language as the CDC moratorium but also require nonpayment due to COVID-19 hardship); the ban on enforcement of residential evictions continued unchanged. By limiting protections to \"covered persons,\" the 11/13/20 order excluded both \"no cause\" terminations and terminations for lease violations that do not fall within the emergency exception. On 12/11/20, the Governor amended and revised the order to clarify that a tenant who does not owe rent is not required to provide a declaration, and landlords cannot commence an eviction against a tenant who does not owe rent unless they pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property . On 01/08/21, this order was reissued and extended through 02/06/21. On 02/05/21, Gov. Pritzker extended the order through 03/06/21. On 03/05/21, the Governor reissued the order and prohibited continuation of eviction actions against covered persons. On 05/28/21, Gov.

On 03/23/20, effective 03/24/20 at 5pm, Gov. Walz announced a moratorium on filing, termination of leases, and enforcement of evictions, excepting evictions where the tenant endangered residents or conducts illegal activity on the property as included in code.

On 07/14/20, effective 08/04/20 at 12:00 am. the Governor issued an executive order that created a ban on filings and also created further exceptions for when a tenant held over after a property owner gave a notice to vacate because the property owner planned to occupy the property.

Essential housing matters included landlord lockout, serious code violation or repair order, and post-eviction relief. On 06/18/20, the Judge announced, effective 06/20/20, that courts would again begin accepting eviction filings and required that a notice informing tenants that they may be eligible for time extension be included. The order also provided that eviction cases commenced prior to or on 3/16/20 would be eligible for virtual settlement.

Cuomo issued an order prohibiting enforcement of residential evictions with no exceptions listed for 90 days. On 05/07/20, this ban was extended until 06/20/20 and tenants were allowed to use their security deposit towards the rent. From 06/20/20 through 07/06/20 [EO 202.48], the Governor's 05/07 order prohibited initiation of a proceeding or enforcement of an eviction for non-payment of rent where the tenant could demonstrate COVID-19 related financial hardship or the receipt of unemployment benefits. EO 202.48, issued 7/06/20, did not continue the stage 2 freeze. On 09/29/20, the Governor announced a ban on enforcement of evictions for tenants who could demonstrate COVID-19 related hardship, including where the order of eviction was issued prior to 03/07/20. This order has been extended several times and is currently extended until 06/16/21. On 06/30/20, legislation was enacted that allowed tenants to assert COVID-19 related hardship as a defense to the court issuing an order of eviction until the end of the Governor's state of emergency. On 12/28/20, the legislature passed a bill that stayed all pending cases and cases filed within 30 days for 60 days; the bill also provides that an eviction may not be filed, go to judgment or be enforced before 05/01/21 so long as the tenant provides a hardship declaration to their landlord, the court, or an official enforcing an eviction.

On 10/09/20, the Chief Administrative Judge allowed eviction matters to proceed, effective 10/12/20. On 03/20/20 Gov. Cuomo issued an order prohibiting enforcement of residential evictions with no exceptions listed for 90 days. On 05/07/20, this ban was extended until 06/20/20 and tenants were allowed to use their security deposit towards the rent. From 06/20/20 through 07/06/20 [EO 202.48], the Governor's 05/07 order prohibited initiation of a proceeding or enforcement of an eviction for non-payment of rent where the tenant could demonstrate COVID-19 related financial hardship or the receipt of unemployment benefits. EO 202.48, issued 7/06/20, did not continue the stage 2 freeze. On 09/29/20, the Governor announced a ban on enforcement of evictions for tenants who could demonstrate COVID-19 related hardship, including where the order of eviction was issued prior to 03/07/20. This order has been extended several times and is currently extended until 06/16/21. On 06/30/20, legislation was enacted that allowed tenants to assert COVID-19 related hardship as a defense to the court issuing an order of eviction until the end of the Governor's state of emergency. On 12/28/20, the legislature passed a bill that stayed all pending cases and cases filed within 30 days for 60 days; the bill also provides that an eviction may not be filed, go to judgment or be enforced before 05/01/21 so long as the tenant provides a hardship declaration to their landlord, the court, or an official enforcing an eviction. On 05/05/21, the Governor signed into law that extended the 12/28 legislation to 8/31/21."},"gsx$plcstandoutbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$until":{"$t":"June 19, 2020"},"gsx$intwtxp":{"$t":""},"gsx$inthotelinfo":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcnoticebool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcnoticetext":{"$t":"Landlords in New York could still give notice of eviction to tenants."},"gsx$intnoticelink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plccofilbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plccofiltext":{"$t":"Courts in New York did not accept eviction filings, so landlords could not file to evict tenants who experienced financial hardship due to the pandemic."},"gsx$intcofillink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcnonpbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnonptext":{"$t":"Courts in New York did not accept eviction filings, so landlords could not file to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent."},"gsx$intplcnonplink":{"$t":"NY_ChiefAdminJudge_Memorandum_061820"},"gsx$plcnofilbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnofiltext":{"$t":"Courts in New York did not accept eviction filings, so landlords could not file to evict tenants for non-emergency reasons."},"gsx$intplcnofillink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plccaresbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plccarestext":{"$t":"Courts in New York did not require landlords to certify that a dwelling is not covered by the CARES Act eviction moratorium prior to filing to evict a tenant, however, filings were not accepted during the state moratorium."},"gsx$intcareslink":{"$t":"NY_ChiefAdminJudge_Memorandum_061820"},"gsx$plctldbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plctldtext":{"$t":"Court deadlines in New York were tolled."},"gsx$intplctldlink":{"$t":"https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/EO%20202.72%20new.pdf"},"gsx$plcnohearbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnoheartext":{"$t":"Eviction hearings could not be held in New York."},"gsx$plcnonewbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnonewtext":{"$t":"Eviction orders were stayed in New York."},"gsx$plcsealbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcsealtext":{"$t":"Eviction case records were not sealed in New York."},"gsx$plccovenfbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plccovenftext":{"$t":"Law enforcement in New York could not enforce an order to remove a tenant who has experienced financial hardship due to the pandemic."},"gsx$intcovenflink":{"$t":"https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S9114"},"gsx$plcpayenfbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcpayenftext":{"$t":"Law enforcement in New York could not enforce an order of eviction for nonpayment of rent."},"gsx$intpayenflink":{"$t":"https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/EO202.28.pdf"},"gsx$plcnoenfbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnoenftext":{"$t":"Law enforcement in New York could not enforce eviction orders issued for non-emergency reasons."},"gsx$plcextmorbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcextmortext":{"$t":"Orders in New York did not extend protections beyond the state of emergency."},"gsx$intextmorlink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcnoshbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnoshtext":{"$t":"New York enacted legislation that prohibits utility shutoffs."},"gsx$intplcnoshlink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcfrrcbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcfrrctext":{"$t":"Legislation in New York required that utilities disconnected for reason of nonpayment be reconnected."},"gsx$intplcfrrclink":{"$t":"None found"},"gsx$plcarsbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcarstext":{"$t":"Landlords in New York were not required to give tenants a grace period of time to pay rental debt that accrues during the pandemic."},"gsx$intplcarslink":{"$t":"No orders found."},"gsx$plcnorepbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcnoreptext":{"$t":"Landlords in New York were not prohibited from reporting missed or late rent payments to credit agencies."},"gsx$intnoreplink":{"$t":"No relevant order."},"gsx$plcnofcbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plcnofctext":{"$t":"Courts in New York did not hear foreclosure cases."},"gsx$plcnofclink":{"$t":"https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S8243C; https://www.nycourts.gov/whatsnew/pdf/AO-157-20.pdf; https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S9114"},"gsx$plclatfbool":{"$t":"1"},"gsx$plclatftext":{"$t":"Landlords in New York could not charge late fees."},"gsx$intplclatflink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcraisebool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcraisetext":{"$t":"Orders in New York did not prohibit landlords from raising rent when renewing leases during the pandemic."},"gsx$intraiselink":{"$t":""},"gsx$plcdebtbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plcdebttext":{"$t":"Rental assistance wasn't available in New York during their 2020 state level eviction moratorium, though it became available to New York renters later in the pandemic."},"gsx$intdebtlink":{"$t":"https://otda.ny.gov/#expanded"},"gsx$plccgbool":{"$t":"0"},"gsx$plccgtext":{"$t":"New York has not guaranteed legal counsel to tenants who face eviction.
