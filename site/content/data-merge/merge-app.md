Eviction records can be merged with other data sources, by name and address, to provide previously unknown information about eviction experiences in other data sources.  All these merges will take place in the Eviction Lab at no cost.

<span class="ak-bold">For your data to be considered for a merge, please apply via email to <a href="mailto:research@evictionlab.org?subject=Data Merge Application" target="_blank">research@evictionlab.org</a> and answer all the following questions:</span>

<ol class="list-initial">
<li>Briefly describe your data.</li>
<li>Why would you like your data merged with eviction records?  What questions do you hope to answer? </li>
<li>The Eviction Lab will merge your dataset with eviction records, merging on research subjects’ name and address.  It will then return de-identified data to you, listing only case IDs and eviction information. Please describe the security measures you will take to protect the confidentiality of evicted people represented in your dataset.</li>
<li>Please attach a copy of your institution’s IRB approach.</li>
</ol>

<span class="ak-bold">By submitting your application, you agree to protect the identities of evicted persons by following this research protocol: </span>

+ Neither I nor anyone on my research team will re-identify the data and publish the names and addresses of evicted persons in any form.

+ Neither I nor anyone on my research team will re-identify the data and distribute individual-level eviction data to outside persons or entities.
