Ashley joined the Eviction Lab as a postdoctoral research associate after completing her Ph.D. in Sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her dissertation research examined the formation and consequences of spatial clustering of children with non-medical exemptions to school vaccine requirements in California. More broadly, her research interests focus on how social networks and local communities provide the social context for individual decisions and events that aggregate to form macro-level patterns across space and time. She is particularly interested in how quantitative and computational methodology can be used with administrative and online data to gain new insights into social behavior and community-level outcomes. When not cleaning data (which she rather enjoys), she goes hiking, puts together puzzles, and has been working her way through Amazon’s list of 100 books to read in a lifetime.
