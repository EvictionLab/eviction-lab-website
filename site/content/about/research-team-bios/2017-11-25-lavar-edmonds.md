Lavar Edmonds received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Mary Washington and a master’s in Education Policy from the University of Pennsylvania. Guided by experiences as a high school math teacher, his background includes using quantitative methods and big data to study pervasive social inequalities, particularly in education. In college, he worked as the data analyst for the school’s Student Transition Program, studying academic outcomes for first-generation and traditionally underrepresented minority students at the university. While at Penn, Lavar worked as a research assistant at the School District of Philadelphia and conducted a semester-long research project examining the causes of teacher exit in Tulsa Public Schools. As a Research Specialist in the Eviction Lab, he is especially interested in studying the intersection of housing policy – namely, causes and consequences of housing instability – with education policy. Beyond policy research, Lavar is a classically-trained violinist, and enjoys music performance and rousing, relatively slow-paced games of tennis.
