Joe received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Applied Math from Macalester College. A San Francisco native, his senior thesis used a survival analysis framework to explore the effect of zip code level tech growth on San Francisco eviction rates. As a researcher, he hopes to establish causal relationships between the effects of wealth consolidation and income inequality on eviction rates. Outside of research, Joe enjoys basketball, board games, and eating.
