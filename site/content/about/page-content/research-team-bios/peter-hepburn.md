Peter joined the Eviction Lab as an Associate Professional Specialist after completing his doctorate in Sociology and Demography at the University of California, Berkeley. Peter's research examines the ways that employment practices and public policies affect children and low-income families. His dissertation analyzed the relationships between parental working schedules, household structure, and childcare arrangements. He has also studied the effects of mass imprisonment on kin networks, exposure to subfelony criminal justice in New York City, and trajectories of employment and disability among American workers. Generally, he's interested in the possibilities that nontraditional quantitative data sources and new methodologies present for better describing social phenomena and their variability. Peter runs one marathon a year and no, he has not qualified for Boston (thank you for asking).
