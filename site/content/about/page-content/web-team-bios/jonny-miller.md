Jonny brings over 17 years of experience in the fields of web development, design, UI/UX, and project management to the team. Previously he worked with one of western Canada’s largest online education providers, where he was the UI/UX Team Lead, and a web developer Jack-of-all. As the CMS Specialist at Eviction Lab, Jonny is inspired to be working with modern content delivery services such as Netlify and Hugo, and the general world of “JAMstack” architecture. When he’s not slinging ones and zeros, Jonny will most likely be writing a song, or recording, as he is an award winning singer/songwriter in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada.
