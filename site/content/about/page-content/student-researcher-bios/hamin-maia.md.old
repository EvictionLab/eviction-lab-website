Maia Hamin is a junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Princeton with certificates in Cognitive Science and Technology and Society. She developed her interest in natural language processing as a research mentor at the Princeton AI4ALL program, where she designed and led a project to create a solution to the Fake News Challenge with high-achieving high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds. On campus, she is the Editor-in-Chief of the Princeton Tiger (campusâ€™ oldest, best, and only humor magazine) and a co-organizer of a departmental reading group on Sociology and Ethics in Computer Science. In the lab, she is excited to experiment with programmatic approaches to tasks in natural language processing and to use data to explore the relationship between eviction, poverty, and the law.
