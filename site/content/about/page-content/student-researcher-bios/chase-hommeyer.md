Chase is a current undergraduate at Princeton University, pursuing a concentration in Sociology, with certificates in Statistics & Machine Learning and Theater. She’s a fellow at the Carl A Fields Center for Equality + Cultural Understanding, one of three student members on the Princeton Campus Iconography Committee, and worked at Princeton University Archives Library on a project called “Archiving Student Activism at Princeton.”A native of San Francisco, Chase is also a former downhill ski racer and 400 and 800m track runner. She’s very excited to be a part of the Eviction Lab for the opportunity to learn powerful data analytics skills and learn how to apply those skills to fight social inequality.
