Gracie is a doctoral candidate in Demography and Social Policy at Princeton University, and a medical student at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.  She graduated with an AB from Princeton in 2012 in Public Policy and International Affairs.  Gracie studies health disparities, and how social inequality is reflected in, and perpetuated by, the health care system.   Her recent work has looked at how the effects of abstinence-only education funding on teen reproductive health outcomes varies by state political ideology, and how ACA-facilitated Medicaid expansion altered social determinants of health such as food insecurity.  In her free time Gracie likes to ski, take pictures of everything she cooks, and ask strangers if she can pet their dogs.
