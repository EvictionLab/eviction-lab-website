Gladys is a senior majoring in Economics at Princeton. As part of her independent work, she has researched the effects of monetizing Massive Open Online Courses and plans to expand on this in a senior thesis. On campus, Gladys is involved with Business Today and the Econometrics Society. She became interested in joining the Eviction Lab after reporting on housing in the Bronx for a journalism course, and hopes to learn more about the laws surrounding eviction as well as its intersection with education. In her free time, Gladys enjoys writing, running, and cooking.
