Hyojin Lee is an undergraduate at Princeton University. She is currently pursuing a degree in
chemistry and a certificate from the Classics Department. On campus, she engages in peer
advising and service; as a volunteer for the Pace Center for Civic Engagement, she is particularly
enthusiastic about traveling with other students to Trenton to teach English as a Second
Language (ESL) classes. In her spare time, Hyojin is currently trying to make the jump from
medium- to long-distance running. She also enjoys learning the languages that come her way.
