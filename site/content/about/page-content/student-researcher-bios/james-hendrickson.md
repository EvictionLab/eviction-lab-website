James is a graduate of the University of Michigan, where he obtained a B.A. in Public Policy with a focus on Applied Statistics and Labor Policy. He has worked for several public interest research and advocacy groups, such as the ACLU and the Economic Growth Institute, where he developed a deep interest in the intersection of statistical analysis and policy. Currently serving as a Research Affiliate with the Eviction Lab, James seeks to better understand the impact of eviction on residents of public housing, as well as how local policymakers can best craft housing assistance solutions that will benefit their communities. In his free time, he is an avid dancer and enjoys volunteering in the local arts community.
