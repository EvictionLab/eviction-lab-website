Mabel is an undergraduate student at Princeton pursuing a concentration in Public and International Affairs from the Woodrow Wilson school, with certificates in Latin American Studies and Gender and Sexuality Studies. She’s co-president of Princeton Students for Gender Equality, a cohort member of TigerChallenge at the Keller Center for entrepreneurship, and an active member of Princeton Students for Reproductive Justice and Princeton Latinos y Amigos. In her work as a research assistant in the Eviction Lab, she hopes to be able to use data and statistical analysis to show the deep social inequality in housing and tenant abuse.
