Naomi is a third-year undergraduate in the Sociology department, pursuing a certificate in the Center for Human Values. Prior to beginning at Princeton, she lived in Dakar, Senegal in a year of cultural immersion, fostering an interest in the relationship between development interventions and how they interact with the complexities of people’s lived experiences. Her current research interests include international development, poverty interventions, and mental health disparities, global and domestic. In the lab, she is thrilled to explore the relationship between eviction and educational outcomes. Outside of research, Naomi spends time singing ‘60s and ‘70s folk music and running through the woods of Princeton.
