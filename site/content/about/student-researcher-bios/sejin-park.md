Sejin is currently a senior at Princeton University studying Computer Science. Her main academic and personal interests lie at the intersection of technology and society, and she hopes to pursue a career studying and mediating the interaction of these two fields, especially in developing countries. At the Eviction Lab, she will be working closely with James researching legal infrastructure around housing by utilizing different computer science techniques such as natural language processing. In her free time, she enjoys leading backpacking trips with Princeton Outdoor Action, exploring new places as well as familiar places, a good cup of coffee, and learning to love new things.
