Christopher Groskopf is a journalist and software engineer who lives in the piney woods of East Texas. For the Eviction Lab, Chris lent his expertise in information design and programming toward creation of our eviction mapping strategy, as well as recruitment of technical talent. Currently he's building tools for solving problems with public data at Enigma. Before that, he spent eight years coding in the service of journalism, working on teams including NPR Visuals and Quartz Things. He is the creator of handy open source tools, such as csvkit, and the author of fun-to-cite documentation, like The Quartz Guide to Bad Data. Chris and his wife, Tasneem Raja, run a local news site called The Tyler Loop.
