Abby Bajuniemi is a former visiting professor of Linguistics and Spanish at Macalester College. She completed a PhD in Hispanic and Lusophone Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics at the University of Minnesota, where her research interests centered on language acquisition and sociolinguistics. She translates that love of language structure and teaching into a passion for accessibility and inclusivity in design and content. As part of Eviction Labâ€™s web team and resident User Experience consultant, she conducts research that informs the design and function of the website and its content (English and Spanish). Outside of work, she writes and speaks on the intersection of UX and linguistics and mentors young professional women.
