Lillian is a recent graduate from New York University’s Stern School of Business, where she studied Economics and Global Business and minored in Social Entrepreneurship. She grew up in Hong Kong and have lived in Chicago and New York. Drawing on her experiences living in cities, her undergraduate thesis used General Social Survey data to explore the effect of housing prices on perceptions of inequality. She has also worked with various surveying methods conducting program evaluations for non-profits and customer research at Squarespace. As a Research Specialist at the Eviction Lab, Lillian hopes to investigate the cyclical relationship between housing, poverty, and income inequality. In her free time, she enjoys reading, painting, and playing the ukulele.
