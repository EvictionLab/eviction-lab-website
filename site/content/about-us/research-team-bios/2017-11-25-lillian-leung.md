Lillian is a recent graduate from New York Universityâ€™s Stern School of Business, where she studied Economics and Global Business and minored in Social Entrepreneurship. She grew up in Hong Kong and have lived in Chicago and New York. Drawing on her experiences living in cities, her undergraduate thesis used General Social Survey data to explore the effect of housing prices on perceptions of inequality.
