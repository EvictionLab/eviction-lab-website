We’ve collected over 80 million eviction records going back several years, but we still don’t have them all! We will continue our effort to provide the most comprehensive data on evictions in America and invite you to stay tuned for updates to our dataset by <a href="#mc_embed_signup" class="smoothScroll">signing up for our email list</a>. If we don’t have eviction numbers for your community, you could help by contacting your mayor or county clerk, requesting this information. If you have eviction data we don’t, consider sharing it by writing us at <a href="mailto:research@evictionlab.org" target="_blank">research@evictionlab.org</a>.

In addition to collecting individual records, we also gathered court-reported statistics on eviction filings from as many states as we could. Currently, we have court-reported statistics for 27 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia <a href="https://data-downloads.evictionlab.org/court-reported-stats/ExtStatsFull.xlsx">(download court-reported statistics)</a>. These statistics provide annual counts of evictions filed in counties. To keep things consistent, we haven’t included these statistics in our map of evictions, but we have used them to help validate estimates. Importantly, court-reported statistics also include eviction filing counts for areas not included in our map.
