While other units of geography are all connected (block groups, census tracts, counties, etc.), place boundaries are separate—requiring evictions to be aggregated and estimated differently. In many cases, the estimates of eviction are non-whole numbers (e.g., 0.4, 31.5, 100.6).

One feature of this strategy is that some low population areas could have less than one eviction estimated for that place. This should not be interpreted as half an eviction occurring in that place in a given year but rather as an estimate of the prevalence of eviction in this area. It is important to note that the rate displayed is based on the unrounded estimate as opposed to the rounded number displayed on the map.

Our estimates for “cities/places” are based on the Census definitions of places. For more details on how the estimation process for places differs, please see our <a href="/docs/Eviction Lab Methodology Report.pdf" target="_blank">Methodology Report (PDF)</a>. When downloading any of our “cities” files from the Get the Data page, you will receive the unrounded estimates of eviction/filings.
