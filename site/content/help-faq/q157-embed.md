You can embed the map in your website or blog using the provided embed code. Under the "share" section of the map & data page, click the link button ![link icon](/images/icons/social/social_getlink_48px_inactive.png) to grab the code. You can then paste that code into your own site. The map will show the eviction and census data types you selected.
