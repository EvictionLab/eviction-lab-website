On the map, we have indicated with the symbol [TK] Census tracts and block groups with filing and eviction rates in top 1%. There are areas with high rates because housing insecurity is especially acute there. But there are other considerations as well.

Remember that filing and eviction rates are calculated by dividing the number of filings or evictions in an area by the number of renter homes. That means that very high rates could be the result of (1) a large number of evictions or filings or (2) a small number of renter homes in an area.

Take neighborhoods in Prince George’s County in Maryland. Because the way Maryland records eviction notices, it has a much higher filing rate than everywhere else, but this doesn’t mean it has more evictions. In most jurisdictions, the eviction process starts with an out-of- court notice delivered to a tenant, but in Maryland the process begins with an eviction filed in court. Many landlords file against their tenants every month, resulting in a very high case volume. Here, the number of filings is inflated because of unique court procedures, resulting in a high rate.

Now consider a residential neighborhood bordering a large industrial zone. The Census tract that includes the industrial zone also includes a small residential section with 40 renter homes. If there were 20 evictions from those homes over the course of a year, that would generate an eviction rate
of 50%. Here, the eviction rate is high because the number of renter homes in the area is small. 

There are even cases with filing and eviction rates over 100%. If there is a filing rate over 100% in a given area, it means there were more cases filed in a year than there were renting homes. Some eviction cases end without a tenant leaving the property. In some jurisdictions, tenants are taken to court repeatedly as a means of collecting past due rent.

But remember that high rates can be driven by the denominator, too: low renter homes relative to eviction cases. This might be because of the specific make-up of an area (e.g., rural community, residential area next to a major airport) or the issue of the Census undercounting renters in some areas. A residential neighborhood surrounding a college with 20 evictions but only 10 estimated renter homes would report an eviction rate of 200%. In this case, the high eviction rate is explained by the fact that the Census often doesn’t count seasonal renters (like college students) in its estimate
of the number of renter homes in an area. 

To get a sense of high rates, we recommend you look closely at the raw number of eviction cases and renter homes in your community.
