An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters, whereas foreclosures are involuntary moves that happen to homeowners when a bank or other lending agency repossesses a home.

In our data, an eviction is defined as an eviction judgment issued to a renting home. If a renter at the same address has multiple eviction judgments, we only count the last one.
