Within our data, case information is recorded as separate actions with dates of each action. Our estimate of eviction filings is the total amount of cases each year with a first recorded action in that year. 

Over the course of a year, a landlord may file multiple evictions against the same household. We count each eviction filing when calculating the eviction filing number and rate. If the records indicated that the same household received multiple eviction judgements, we only counted one of them, since a household can be filed on multiple times over the course of a year but not evicted multiple times from the same address.
