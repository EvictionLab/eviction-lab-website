We chose to categorize places in our Rankings (as Large Cities, Mid-sized Cities, or Small Cities & Rural Areas) to allow for more meaningful comparisons among places with similar populations. 

Small Cities & Rural Areas are places with populations under 20,000. We rank 27,403 of these places.
Examples: Clarksdale, MS; Fremont, OH

Mid-sized Cities are places with populations of between 20,000 and 100,000. We rank 1,858 of these places.
Examples: Carson City, CA; Evanston, IL

Small Cities & Rural Areas are places with populations of 100,000 and above. We rank 313 of these places.
Examples: Los Angeles, NYC, Detroit
