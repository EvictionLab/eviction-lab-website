Because these data were collected manually from courts across the country, some areas are missing data over time. In other cases, statistical models indicated that there was too much variance in collection from one year to the next. In these cases, we filled in some of those gaps by “imputing”
data based on a set of procedures listed in our <a href="/docs/Eviction Lab -Methodology Report v.1.0.0.pdf" target="_blank">Methodology Report (PDF)</a>. We use the imputed dataset in our maps, but we also wanted to give everyone the opportunity to download non-imputed data.
