We have developed a <a href="#">Media Guide</a> and <a href="#">Teacher’s Guide</a>. We’ll be highlighting how journalists, teachers, community organizers, policymakers, and engaged citizens have used our data—both on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/evictionlab/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/evictionlab" target="_blank">Twitter</a> accounts and our Updates pages. You can also download <a href="http://www.evictedbook.com/reading-group-guides" target="_blank">reading group guides</a> for the book <span class="ital">Evicted</span>.
