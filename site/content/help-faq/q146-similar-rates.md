It’s probably not because almost all eviction cases end in eviction but because of our inability to collect all eviction cases in your area. We attempted to collect every court record related to eviction—including filings that didn’t result in eviction—but some of our data sources prioritized cases that ended in a civil judgment. For example, in some areas, dismissals were not recorded, which deflated the total filings numbers. When this happens, filing and eviction rates are very similar.
