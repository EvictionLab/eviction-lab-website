Eviction records contain addresses. We had these addresses geocoded and spatially joined by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). This process allowed us to match each address record to a latitude and a longitude. Then, by overlaying the geographic boundaries on top of these points, we can observe how many evictions took place in that area.
