The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from 48 states and the District of Columbia. Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant and plaintiff names, the defendant’s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. We combined these records with demographic information from the Census to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening. 

The Eviction Lab has also collected state reported, county-level statistics on landlord-tenant cases filed from 27 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. This includes two of the states where we are missing individual-level eviction records – North and South Dakota. Together, these statistics represent all the known information on the number of evictions filed in counties and made publically-available by municipalities.
