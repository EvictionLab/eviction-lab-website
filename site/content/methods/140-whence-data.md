We have accumulated over 80 million records related to eviction. The Eviction Lab directly collected court records from 12 states. But many states either did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information. Accordingly, the Eviction Lab then purchased more comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from two companies: LexisNexis and American Information Research Services Inc. 

We also collected state reported, county-level statistics on landlord-tenant cases filed from 27 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. This information was collected either from online reports or by contacting state judiciaries directly.
