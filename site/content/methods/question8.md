Court records contain errors caused by data entry mistakes or technological glitches. Cases can be filed with incomplete information or entered into the system with spelling errors in the names or addresses. To create the best estimates, all data we obtained underwent a rigorous cleaning protocol. This included formatting the data so that each observation represented a household; cleaning and standardizing the names and addresses; and dropping duplicate cases. The details of this process can be found in the Methodology Report.
