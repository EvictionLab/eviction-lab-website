The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from all fifty states. Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant or plaintiff names, the defendantâ€™s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. In addition, we collected demographic variables from the Census which we combined with the years in which we had data. This allows us to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening.
