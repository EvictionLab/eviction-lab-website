The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from all fifty states. Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant and plaintiff names, the defendantâ€™s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. We combined these records with demographic information from the Census to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening.
