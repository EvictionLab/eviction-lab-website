As mentioned in our <a href="/updates/blog/welcome-to-the-eviction-lab/">Welcome</a> blog post, we're offering <a href="/get-the-data">the full Eviction Lab dataset</a> as a public service in the hope that you will "take this information and deepen what we know about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of residential insecurity." 

If you use Eviction Lab data, please let us know! Share your findings with us by emailing <a href="mailto:research@evictionlab.org">research@evictionlab.org</a>. We may feature your study on this website and look forward to learning from your work.
