Since the Eviction Lab’s inception, we’ve been in constant pursuit of a seemingly simple question: how many evictions take place in the United States each year? After countless hours of data collection and research, we are finally able to produce some of the first estimates of the national prevalence of eviction. 
 
Below you will find a table that shows the number of evictions and filings we are currently estimating, as well as their respective rates. Rates are calculated by dividing eviction filings or evictions by the number of renter occupied households in the areas where we had eviction data. We did this to ensure that the eviction rates you see on <a href="/">evictionlab.org</a> are based solely on areas of the country that are represented in our data and on the map.

As the figures above show, our current data suggest there is nearly 1 eviction filing for every 17 renter households each year, with 1 in 40 receiving an eviction judgement against them. To put these numbers into perspective, at the peak of the financial crisis in 2010, <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/research/foreclosure-report/national-foreclosure-report-10-year.pdf" target="_blank">estimates suggest</a> slightly over one million foreclosures were completed nationally. By comparison, we see almost a million evictions against tenants every single year. The narrative on housing often focuses on displacement among homeowners, but our data suggests that there is an ongoing epidemic of eviction and displacement in the renting market. As you’ll see from the graphs below, the national eviction/filing rate has stayed very consistent over time, with small declines over the last few years.

It is important to note that there are still several places where we do not have all eviction records, including New York and California. As a result, our current national estimates of the total number of evictions/filings are underestimating the overall prevalence. As we gather additional data, these estimates will be updated.

Our data collection efforts are ongoing, and we will continue to publish new data that will help us create a better picture of how eviction affects the nation as a whole.
