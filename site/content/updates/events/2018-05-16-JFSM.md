As part of its 150th Anniversary Celebration, Jewish Family Services (JFS) convenes community stakeholders to address the urgent need for safe and affordable housing, which has emerged as a leading social justice issue of our time.

JFS proudly welcomes Professor Matthew Desmond, whose local research, as chronicled in the Pulitzer-Prize-winning book, <span class="ital">Evicted â€“ Poverty and Profit in the American City</span>, cast a spotlight on a complex problem that demands collaborative solutions.
