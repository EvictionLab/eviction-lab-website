In his book Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,Matthew Desmond examines how disruptive the loss of housing is to a family’s stability. Jobs are put at risk, as parents scramble to find housing after an eviction. Children may miss school days or be forced to relocate to a new school, perhaps even to a different city.  Securing money for rent becomes a priority, straining household finances needed for food and medicine. 

Dr. Desmond’s vantage point is national. Our Think Tank will examine the issues and themes of Evicted locally. We hope attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of housing insecurity in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati, how agencies and public officials are trying to address it, and some idea of how each of us can contribute to solutions that work.
