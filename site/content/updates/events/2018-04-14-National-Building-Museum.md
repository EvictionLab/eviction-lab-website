The National Building Museum announces a new, ground-breaking exhibition exploring the causes and impacts of eviction.

A collaboration with Matthew Desmond, Professor of Sociology at Princeton University, a MacArthur “Genius” Fellow, and best-selling author, Evicted will offer an immersive experience bringing our visitors into the world of low-income renter eviction. With unique design elements and striking graphics, the exhibition will challenge adults and youth to face the enormity of a difficult subject, while providing context and a call to action.

The exhibition will employ a rich array of images and audio interviews. Specially commissioned visual infographics and forward-thinking design will introduce visitors to the numbers and statistics they need to know in order to understand the crisis. Rates of evictions in different markets will make evident the depths of the problem. Working together, these elements amplify the stories of tenant families, as they explain in their own words and images the impact eviction has on them and their loved ones.
