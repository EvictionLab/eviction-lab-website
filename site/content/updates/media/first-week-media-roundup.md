During The Eviction Lab's first week online, we were encouraged to see interest in our dataset and website—and the eviction epidemic it reveals—from a number of major national media outlets. 

<span class="ak-bold">The New York Times</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html" target="_blank">profiled Richmond, VA</a> (#2 in our <a href="https://evictionlab.org/rankings/#/evictions?r=United%20States&a=0&d=evictionRate&l=1" target="_blank">Eviction Rankings</a>) to demonstrate the effect of its staggering eviction numbers on residents of one city. NPR's <span class="ak-bold">Fresh Air</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/12/601783346/first-ever-evictions-database-shows-were-in-the-middle-of-a-housing-crisis" target="_blank">interviewed Matthew Desmond</a> about both the Lab's work, and the experience of writing <a class="ital" href="http://evictedbook.com" target="_blank">Evicted</a>. <span class="ak-bold">Curbed</span> <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2018/4/9/17216054/eviction-records-data-matthew-desmond-princeton" target="_blank">dedicated an article</a> to the pervasive scope of the crisis nationwide.

Equally remarkable, however, has been the local media coverage of eviction rates in cities across the country. In Richmond, it has been <a href="http://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-landlord-reacts-to-citys-eviction-rate/1109945428" target="_blank">an ongoing story</a>. News outlets in <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/04/13/eviction-rate-spikes-again-across-phoenix-affordable-housing-crisis-worsens/508696002/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/eviction-rates-in-north-charleston-columbia-some-of-the-highest/article_bebe69e2-3cd3-11e8-b412-331e6a815e34.html" target="_blank">South Carolina</a>, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180415/eviction-rate-in-ri-leads-region" target="_blank">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="https://www.wpr.org/southeastern-wisconsin-counties-have-highest-eviction-rates-state" target="_blank">Wisconsin</a> and more have all used Eviction Lab data to reckon with the problem their area.
