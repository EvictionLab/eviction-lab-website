The New York Times has chosen Richmond, VA (listed at #2 in our <a href="/rankings">Eviction Rankings</a>) as the focus of a front-page story, which also profiles Matthew Desmond and <a href="/about/#work">The Eviction Lab's work</a> in collecting over 83 million eviction records from across the country.

The article details the "churning machine" of evictions in Richmond, driven by a court system that is often as inscrutable to tenants as it is unsparingly efficient in rendering judgments.
