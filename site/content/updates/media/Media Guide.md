The Eviction Lab is excited to partner with journalists across the country. One of the central tenets of this lab is to be <span class="ital">accessible</span> and <span class="ital">useful</span> to those interested in exploring the link between poverty, eviction, and housing in America. 

For those who are new to the issue, <a href="/why-eviction-matters">Why Eviction Matters</a> is an introduction to both the process and effects of eviction. Before jumping into the findings, we suggest you look at the <a href="/help-faq">Help & FAQ</a> section, which answers basic questions about the website and eviction data. 
 
We've built several tools that allow you to explore eviction in your community. The interactive map allows you to explore evictions at the state, county, city, or neighborhood level. You can also examine how eviction rates have changed across time and plug in demographic information to view the kinds of neighborhoods evictions are concentrated in. After selecting an area of interest, you can click “View More Data” to see detailed information on income and rent in your area, as well as graphs that display what eviction rates over time. Custom reports, PowerPoint slides, and the data are available. 

There are countless untold stories. Here are a few suggestions of possible questions to pursue:

+ <span class="ak-bold">Prevalence:</span> For many areas across the country, our data offer the first public estimates of eviction. The sheer number of families affected by eviction is staggering. Are there certain areas in your city that have more evictions than others? Why? 

+ <span class="ak-bold">Comparison:</span> Eviction is fascinating because it does not affect every area uniformly. How does your area compare to other similar places? How do rates change from year to year? What factors could be contributing to a decrease in evictions over time?

+ <span class="ak-bold">Policy/Economics:</span> How does the legal system in your community shape evictions? What does the affordable housing situation look like in your area, and how might it affect hospitals, schools, communities, and other institutions? 

+ <span class="ak-bold">Investigate:</span> There are many investigative stories to tell. Who owns your city? What landlords are responsible for the lion’s share of evictions? How long does the average tenant spend in eviction court? Who is being most affected by eviction? And what policies are in place to prevent eviction or soften its blow?
