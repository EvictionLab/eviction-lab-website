NPR's <span class="ital">Marketplace</span> features an interview between host David Brancaccio and Matthew Desmond, detailing the shocking volume of evictions in the US, their deeper causes, and how the hotspots of the eviction crisis are often places you wouldn't expect.

<span class="ak-bold">Desmond:</span> "If you read the news, you'd think that the housing crisis is basically in Seattle, and New York City, and San Francisco. And that's true. You know, the rents in those cities have really exploded over the last decade. But when you look at evictions, you don't see them only happening in those places. In fact, the hotspots of evictions are in cities that don't get a lot of coverage ...  What this data set allow us to do, I think, is to recognize that the housing crisis is much bigger and deeper than we thought. It's not just on the coast or in our global cities, it's in a lot of different places. It raises all these questions about what's going on, questions that we know that we can't answer by ourselves, which is why we wanted to get the data out as quickly as we could."
