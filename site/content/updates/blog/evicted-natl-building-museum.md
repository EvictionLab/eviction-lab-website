First came <a href="http://evictedbook.com" target="_blank">the book <span class="ital">Evicted</span></a>, with its heartbreaking stories of families and individuals struggling to maintain stable shelter. Next came the release of <a href="/map" target="_blank">The Eviction Lab's database</a>, revealing the often-surprising scale and span of the eviction crisis. Now eviction and its consequences are explored in a 3-dimensional, immersive presentation at <a href="https://www.nbm.org/exhibition/evicted/" target="_blank">The National Building Museum's <span class="ital">Evicted</span> exhibition</a>.

The exhibit offers photographic and video profiles of two families threatened with eviction, along with tactile infographics and artifacts of the experience of a forced move, such as belongings piled on a pallet and wrapped in plastic for storage. <a href="/map" target="_blank">The Eviction Lab's map</a> is also accessible to visitors via tablets, so they can explore the impact of the problem in locations of their choice.
