      <description>Since the Eviction Lab’s inception, we’ve been in constant pursuit of a seemingly simple question: how many evictions take place in the United States each year? After countless hours of data collection and research, we are finally able to produce some of the first estimates of the national prevalence of eviction.
Below you will find a table that shows our current national estimates of eviction filings and evictions, as well as their respective rates.</description>

      <description>In recent years, renters’ housing costs have far outpaced their incomes, driving a nationwide affordability crisis. Current data from the American Housing Survey show that most poor renting families spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing costs. Under these conditions, 1 millions of Americans today are at risk of losing their homes through eviction.
An eviction occurs when a landlord forcibly expels a tenant from a residence. While the majority of evictions are attributed to nonpayment of rent, landlords may evict tenants for a variety of other reasons, including property damage, nuisance complaints, or lease violations.</description>
