      <description>Today, the majority of poor renting families in America spend over half of their income on housing costs, and eviction is transforming their lives. Yet little is known about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of housing insecurity.
The Eviction Lab is a team of researchers, students, and website architects who believe that a stable, affordable home is central to human flourishing and economic mobility. Accordingly, understanding the sudden, traumatic loss of home through eviction is foundational to understanding poverty in America.</description>

      <description>Matthew Desmond started studying housing, poverty, and eviction in 2008, living and working alongside poor tenants and their landlords in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Combining ethnographic fieldwork with original statistical analyses, Desmond discovered that eviction was incredibly prevalent in low-income communities and functioned as a cause, not just a condition, of poverty. This work was summarized in his book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City (2016).
When speaking to people and policymakers across the country about Evicted, Desmond realized the need to collect national data on eviction to address fundamental questions about residential instability, forced moves, and poverty in America.</description>

      <description>Through this website, the Eviction Lab has made nationwide eviction data publicly available and accessible. We hope this data is used by policymakers, community organizers, journalists, educators, non-profit organizations, students, and citizens interested in understanding more about housing, eviction, and poverty in their own backyards. You can look at evictions over time, map evictions in the United States, compare the eviction rates of different neighborhoods, cities, or states, and generate custom reports about America’s eviction epidemic.</description>

      <description>The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from 48 states and the District of Columbia. Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant and plaintiff names, the defendant’s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. We combined these records with demographic information from the Census to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening.</description>

      <description>No. Evictions can happen outside of the courtroom, as when landlords pay renters to leave or execute illegal lockouts. There is some evidence that “informal evictions” are more common than “formal”, court-ordered evictions. Informal evictions are not captured in our dataset. Moreover, while we have tried to collect every recorded court-ordered eviction case, going back to 2000, some records were unavailable. Some courts seal eviction cases; others have not archived data; still others make recording eviction cases time-consuming and difficult.</description>

      <description>First, we requested a bulk report of cases directly from courts. These reports included all recorded information related to eviction-related cases. Second, we conducted automated record collection from online portals, via web scraping and text parsing protocols. Third, we partnered with companies that carry out manual collection of records, going directly into the courts and extracting the relevant case information by hand.</description>

      <description>We have accumulated over 80 million records related to eviction. The Eviction Lab directly collected court records from 12 states. But many states either did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information. Accordingly, the Eviction Lab then purchased more comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from two companies: LexisNexis Risk Solutions and American Information Research Services Inc.
We also collected state reported, county-level statistics on landlord-tenant cases filed from 27 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia.</description>

      <description>On the map, we have indicated with the symbol Census tracts and block groups with filing and eviction rates in the top 1%. There are areas with high rates because housing insecurity is especially acute there. But there are other considerations as well.
Remember that filing and eviction rates are calculated by dividing the number of filings or evictions in an area by the number of renter homes. That means that very high rates could be the result of (1) a large number of evictions or filings or (2) a small number of renter homes in an area.</description>

      <description>On the map, we have indicated with the symbol states with underestimated eviction counts. Of course, some places have low eviction rates because there are few renters living there or because there are very few evictions. But some states and the District of Columbia have underestimated eviction counts in our dataset for a variety of reasons.
Because coverage within our dataset is dependent on the area and year, it is possible for a single county to have fluctuations in data collection over time.</description>

      <description>It’s probably not because almost all eviction cases end in eviction but because of our inability to collect all eviction cases in your area. We attempted to collect every court record related to eviction—including filings that didn’t result in eviction—but some of our data sources prioritized cases that ended in a civil judgment. For example, in some areas, dismissals were not recorded, which deflated the total filings numbers. When this happens, filing and eviction rates are very similar.</description>

      <guid>/methods/page-content/150-filing-vs-rate/</guid>
      <description>A “filing rate” is the ratio of the number of evictions filed in an area over the number of renter-occupied homes in that area. An “eviction rate” is the subset of those homes that received an eviction judgement in which renters were ordered to leave. The filing rate also counts all eviction cases filed in an area, including multiple cases filed against the same address in the same year. But an eviction rate only counts a single address who received an eviction judgement.</description>

      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property. An eviction is a judgment from the court that a tenant should be removed. As not every eviction filing results in an eviction, the filing rate will always be higher in a given area than the eviction rate.</description>

      <description>While other units of geography are all connected (block groups, census tracts, counties, etc.), place boundaries are separate—requiring evictions to be aggregated and estimated differently. In many cases, the estimates of eviction are non-whole numbers (e.g., 0.4, 31.5, 100.6).
One feature of this strategy is that some low population areas could have less than one eviction estimated for that place. This should not be interpreted as half an eviction occurring in that place in a given year but rather as an estimate of the prevalence of eviction in this area.</description>

 Small Cities &amp;amp; Rural Areas are places with populations under 20,000. We rank 27,403 of these places. Examples: Clarksdale, MS; Fremont, OH
 Mid-sized Cities are places with populations of between 20,000 and 100,000. We rank 1,858 of these places.</description>

      <description>Eviction records contain addresses. We had these addresses geocoded and spatially joined by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). This process allowed us to match each address record to a latitude and a longitude. Then, by overlaying the geographic boundaries on top of these points, we can observe how many evictions took place in that area.</description>

      <description>We linked individual records from overlapping data sources. Through this procedure, we determined that the content of the records (e.g., address, name information) had a high rate of validity. In addition, we obtained statistics from 27 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia that gave us numbers of cases filed per year at the county level. These figures allowed us to know what proportion of all cases filed in an area were present in our data.</description>

      <description>An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters, whereas foreclosures are involuntary moves that happen to homeowners when a bank or other lending agency repossesses a home.
In our data, an eviction is defined as an eviction judgment issued to a renting home. If a renter at the same address has multiple eviction judgments, we only count the last one.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q210-eviction-rate/</guid>
      <description>An eviction rate is the number of evictions per 100 renter homes in an area. An eviction rate of 5% means that 5 of every 100 renter homes faced eviction in the selected area that year.
Information on the number of renter homes in an area comes from the U.S. Census and ESRI Business Analyst demographic estimates. We interpolate between 2000 and 2010 Census years for renting households to calculate yearly estimates for all geographies.</description>

      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property.
Within our data, case information is recorded as separate actions with dates of each action. Our estimate of eviction filings is the total amount of cases each year with a first recorded action in that year.
Over the course of a year, a landlord may file multiple evictions against the same household.</description>

      <description>Since eviction records do not include demographic information like age or gender, we do not have direct access to these numbers. However, local studies show that households with children are especially vulnerable to forced displacement. While we don&amp;rsquo;t have the full picture now, the Eviction Lab dataset enables users to create estimates on a scale that was previously impossible, and important questions like these can be addressed in future research.</description>

      <description>Matthew Desmond takes readers into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee and tells the stories of eight families who struggle to keep a roof over their heads as they face extreme poverty, eviction and economic exploitation.
The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today.</description>

After countless hours of data collection and research, we are finally able to produce some of the first estimates of the national prevalence of eviction.
Below you will find a table that shows our current national estimates of eviction filings and evictions, as well as their respective rates.</description>

And then, when things began to get real and the project took shape, we drew a collective deep breath as we grasped the magnitude of the challenges ahead of us.
First, for our Map &amp;amp; Data tool, we needed to display eviction rates on a map of the entire country, at scales ranging from US states to Census block groups and everything in between.</description>

Now eviction and its consequences are explored in a 3-dimensional, immersive presentation at The National Building Museum&amp;rsquo;s Evicted exhibition.
 
The exhibit offers photographic and video profiles of two families threatened with eviction, along with tactile infographics and artifacts of the process of a forced move, such as belongings piled on a pallet and wrapped in plastic for storage.</description>

Desmond, on the estimate that 2.3 million people faced eviction in 2016:
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s twice the number of Americans that die in car accidents every day. That&amp;rsquo;s twice the number of people who get arrested for drug offenses every year.

      <description>Join the Urban Institute for a discussion about a new data source on evictions in the US and its value for community response.
A shortage of affordable rental housing leaves millions of US households struggling to pay rent and avoid eviction. As documented by the sociologist and ethnographer Matthew Desmond and other housing scholars, evictions destabilize renters’ current housing and affect their work, health, education, and future housing options. Preventing eviction can disrupt risky life trajectories that add costs to communities and impede opportunity.</description>

Desmond: &amp;ldquo;If you read the news, you&amp;rsquo;d think that the housing crisis is basically in Seattle, and New York City, and San Francisco. And that&amp;rsquo;s true. You know, the rents in those cities have really exploded over the last decade.</description>

The article details the &amp;ldquo;churning machine&amp;rdquo; of evictions in Richmond, driven by a court system that is often as inscrutable to tenants as it is unsparingly efficient in rendering judgments.</description>

      <description>Evictionlab.org can be a resource for teachers working with students on data analysis, public policy, social studies, and more. Students in service organizations or those who act as representatives to local governing bodies may also benefit from learning about housing issues in their community.
We would love to hear from teachers who use evictionlab.org in their classrooms. We hope to design more resources for educators in the future and would value knowing how students engaged with our work.</description>

      <description>In recent years, renters’ housing costs have far outpaced their incomes, driving a nationwide affordability crisis. Current data from the American Housing Survey show that most poor renting families spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing costs. Under these conditions, 1 millions of Americans today are at risk of losing their homes through eviction.
An eviction occurs when a landlord forcibly expels a tenant from a residence. While the majority of evictions are attributed to nonpayment of rent, landlords may evict tenants for a variety of other reasons, including property damage, nuisance complaints, or lease violations.</description>
