      <description>The red bubbles represent the eviction rate or eviction filing rate. Bigger bubbles are bigger numbers. Smaller bubbles are smaller numbers.</description>

      <description>The blue represents the concentration of the Census value you selected. For example, if you selected “population,” a darker blue means a higher population and a lighter blue means a lower population.</description>

      <description>We have accumulated over 80 million records related to eviction. The Eviction Lab directly collected court records from 13 states. But many states either did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information. Accordingly, the Eviction Lab then purchased more comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from two companies: LexisNexis Risk Solutions and American Information Research Services Inc.
For more information about our data collection, see our Methods page and Methodology Report (PDF).</description>

      <description>We used estimates of renter-occupied households from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses and ESRI Business Analyst 2016. For further details on the renter-occupied household variable, please read our Methodology Report (PDF).
We used the following surveys for other demographic variables listed on the website and data download:

      <description>We’ve collected over 80 million eviction records going back several years, but we still don’t have them all! We will continue our effort to provide the most comprehensive data on evictions in America and invite you to stay tuned for updates to our dataset by signing up for our email list. If we don’t have eviction numbers for your community, you could help by contacting your mayor or county clerk, requesting this information.</description>

      <description>Because you live in Arkansas, North Dakota, Alaska, or South Dakota, states for which we do not have enough individual-level eviction records to make an estimate. In these states, we can display reported statistics about eviction filings, however. For more details about how we handled data from different sources see our Methods page.</description>

      <title>My area shows a high filing or eviction rate. What does this mean?</title>
      <link>/help-faq/page-content/q144-high-rate/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 20:43:49 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q144-high-rate/</guid>
      <description>On the map, we have indicated with the symbol Census tracts and block groups with filing and eviction rates in the top 1%. There are areas with high rates because housing insecurity is especially acute there. But there are other considerations as well.
Remember that filing and eviction rates are calculated by dividing the number of filings or evictions in an area by the number of renter homes. That means that very high rates could be the result of (1) a large number of evictions or filings or (2) a small number of renter homes in an area.</description>

      <title>My state shows a low filing or eviction rate. What does this mean?</title>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q145-low-rate/</guid>
      <description>On the map, we have indicated with the symbol states with underestimated eviction counts. Of course, some places have low eviction rates because there are few renters living there or because there are very few evictions. But some states and the District of Columbia have underestimated eviction counts in our dataset for a variety of reasons.
Because coverage within our dataset is dependent on the area and year, it is possible for a single county to have fluctuations in data collection over time.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q146-similar-rates/</guid>
      <description>It’s probably not because almost all eviction cases end in eviction but because of our inability to collect all eviction cases in your area. We attempted to collect every court record related to eviction—including filings that didn’t result in eviction—but some of our data sources prioritized cases that ended in a civil judgment. For example, in some areas, dismissals were not recorded, which deflated the total filings numbers. When this happens, filing and eviction rates are very similar.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q152-filings/</guid>
      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property. An eviction is a judgment from the court that a tenant should be removed. As not every eviction filing results in an eviction, the filing rate will always be higher in a given area than the eviction rate.</description>

      <description>While other units of geography are all connected (block groups, census tracts, counties, etc.), place boundaries are separate—requiring evictions to be aggregated and estimated differently. In many cases, the estimates of eviction are non-whole numbers (e.g., 0.4, 31.5, 100.6).
One feature of this strategy is that some low population areas could have less than one eviction estimated for that place. This should not be interpreted as half an eviction occurring in that place in a given year but rather as an estimate of the prevalence of eviction in this area.</description>

      <description>Because these data were collected manually from courts across the country, some areas are missing data over time. In other cases, statistical models indicated that there was too much variance in collection from one year to the next. In these cases, we filled in some of those gaps by “imputing” data based on a set of procedures listed in our Methodology Report (PDF). We use the imputed dataset in our maps, but we also wanted to give everyone the opportunity to download non-imputed data.</description>

      <description>We chose to categorize places in our Rankings (as Large Cities, Mid-sized Cities, or Small Cities &amp;amp; Rural Areas) to allow for more meaningful comparisons among places with similar populations.
 Small Cities &amp;amp; Rural Areas are places with populations under 20,000. We rank 27,403 of these places. Examples: Clarksdale, MS; Fremont, OH
 Mid-sized Cities are places with populations of between 20,000 and 100,000. We rank 1,858 of these places.</description>

      <description>Eviction records contain addresses. We had these addresses geocoded and spatially joined by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). This process allowed us to match each address record to a latitude and a longitude. Then, by overlaying the geographic boundaries on top of these points, we can observe how many evictions took place in that area.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q200-what-is-eviction/</guid>
      <description>An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters, whereas foreclosures are involuntary moves that happen to homeowners when a bank or other lending agency repossesses a home.
In our data, an eviction is defined as an eviction judgment issued to a renting home. If a renter at the same address has multiple eviction judgments, we only count the last one.</description>

      <guid>/help-faq/page-content/q210-eviction-rate/</guid>
      <description>An eviction rate is the number of evictions per 100 renter homes in an area. An eviction rate of 5% means that 5 of every 100 renter homes faced eviction in the selected area that year.
Information on the number of renter homes in an area comes from the U.S. Census and ESRI Business Analyst demographic estimates. We interpolate between 2000 and 2010 Census years for renting households to calculate yearly estimates for all geographies.</description>

      <description>An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property.
Within our data, case information is recorded as separate actions with dates of each action. Our estimate of eviction filings is the total amount of cases each year with a first recorded action in that year.
Over the course of a year, a landlord may file multiple evictions against the same household.</description>

      <description>Since eviction records do not include demographic information like age or gender, we do not have direct access to these numbers. However, local studies show that households with children are especially vulnerable to forced displacement. While we don&amp;rsquo;t have the full picture now, the Eviction Lab dataset enables users to create estimates on a scale that was previously impossible, and important questions like these can be addressed in future research.</description>

      <description>We have developed a Media Guide and Teacher’s Guide. We’ll be highlighting how journalists, teachers, community organizers, policymakers, and engaged citizens have used our data—both on our Facebook and Twitter accounts and our Updates pages. You can also download reading group guides for the book Evicted.</description>
