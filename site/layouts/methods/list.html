++++++++++++++++++++++ READ ME +++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: each faq method is built with an open and
close partial, to insulate from borking that code. Variables
are passed to the partial via (dict) definintions.

Double quotes need to be escaped in the (dict) definitions,
with a backslash, like this: \"example\"

The explanation goes between the partials, and can contain any html
that may be needed, ie links, images, etc.

NOTE: each item must have a unique "UniqueNumber". A tried
a million ways to automate this with code, but Hugo does
NOT (according to the Hugo discussion boards) currently
have that capability :( Or at least I don't ;)

The system I'm using is each method goes up by 10, starting at 100,
to leave space for future additions. Feel free to change
this, as long as the result is unique.

      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "What is the Eviction Lab?" "UniqueNumber" "100" ) }}
           <p>The Eviction Lab is a research organization dedicated to studying the prevalence, causes, and consequences of eviction. The database it has built represents the largest accumulation of U.S. court records related to eviction ever compiled.</p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

      <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "What data has the Eviction Lab collected?" "UniqueNumber" "110" ) }}
           <p>The data we collected is comprised of formal eviction records from all fifty states. 
             Eviction records include information related to an eviction court case, such as defendant or plaintiff names, the defendant’s address, monetary judgment information, and an outcome for the case. 
             In addition, we collected demographic variables from the Census which we combined with the years in which we had data. 
             This allows us to paint a better picture of the areas in which these evictions are happening. </p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

      <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "Are these all the evictions that have taken place?" "UniqueNumber" "120" ) }}
           <p>No. Evictions can happen outside of the courtroom, as when landlords pay renters to leave or execute illegal lockouts. 
             There is some evidence that “informal evictions” are more common than “formal”, court-ordered evictions. 
             Informal evictions are not captured in our dataset. 
             Moreover, while we have tried to collect every recorded court-ordered eviction case, going back to 2000, some records were unavailable. 
             Some courts seal eviction cases; others have not archived data; still others make recording eviction cases time-consuming and difficult.</p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

      <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "How did you collect the data?" "UniqueNumber" "130" ) }}
           <p>First, we requested a bulk report of cases directly from courts. These reports include all recorded information regarding to eviction-related cases. 
             Second, we conducted automated record collection from online portals, via web scraping and text parsing protocols. 
             Third, we partnered with companies that carry out manual collection of records, going directly into the courts and extracting the relevant case information by hand.</p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

            <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "Where do your data come from?" "UniqueNumber" "140" ) }}
           <p>We have accumulated over 80 million records related to eviction. The Eviction Lab directly collected court records from 15 states. 
             But many states either did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information. 
             Accordingly, the Eviction Lab then purchased more comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from two companies: LexisNexis and American Information Research Services Inc.</p>

         <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "What is the difference between a filing rate and an eviction rate?" "UniqueNumber" "150" ) }}
           <p>A “filing rate” the percentage of renter homes in an area that were threatened with a court-ordered eviction. 
             An “eviction rate” is the subset of those homes that received an eviction judgement in which renters were ordered to leave.  
             That’s why the filing rate is always bigger than the eviction rate. 
            </p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

      <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "How did you calculate the filing/eviction rate?" "UniqueNumber" "160" ) }}
           <p>For the denominator of our rate, we used the number of renting households in each area. 
             Estimates of these numbers were drawn from the Census and American Community Survey (ACS) at geographies down to the block group. </p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

            <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "How did you clean the data?" "UniqueNumber" "170" ) }}
           <p>Court records contain errors caused by data entry mistakes or technological glitches. 
             Cases can be filed with incomplete information or entered into the system with spelling errors in the names or addresses. 
             To create the best estimates, all data we obtained underwent a rigorous cleaning protocol. 
             This included formatting the data so that each observation represented a household; cleaning and standardizing the names and addresses; and dropping duplicate cases. 
             The details of this process can be found in the Methodology Report.
            </p>

         <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "How were you able to determine the amount of evictions in each neighborhood?" "UniqueNumber" "180" ) }}
           <p>Eviction records contain addresses. We had these addresses geocoded and spatially joined by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). 
             This process allowed us to match each address record to a latitude and a longitude. 
             Then, by overlaying the geographic boundaries on top of these points, we can observe how many evictions took place in that area. 
            </p>
      {{ partial "method-close" }}

      <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "For regions where you did not have comprehensive data, how did you estimate the eviction rate?" "UniqueNumber" "190" ) }}
           <p>We used a common practice for missing data called “imputation.” 
             This process applied statistical models to our existing data to estimate eviction counts for missing regions. 
             For more information on this, please see the Methodology Report.</p>

            <!-- method item -->
      {{ partial "method-open" (dict "Method" "How did you validate your estimates?" "UniqueNumber" "200" ) }}
           <p>We linked individual records from overlapping data sources. 
             Through this procedure, we determined that the content of the records (e.g., address, name information) purchased from LexisNexis had a high rate of validity in comparison to previously received state court data. 
             In addition, we obtained statistics from 31 states that gave us numbers of cases filed per year at the county level. 
             These figures allowed us to know what proportion of all cases filed in an area were present in our data.
