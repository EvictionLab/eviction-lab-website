As the world seeks to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers across the U.S. are responding to the heightened insecurity so many face.

This table details where local governments, states, and the federal government have taken action. We continually update this table and <a href="https://evictionlab.org/contact/">welcome tips</a> regarding what your community is putting into place. Please note that as policies are changing daily, this table may not be comprehensive of all orders that are in effect in towns, cities, and counties. 

For more information about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) eviction moratorium, in effect September 4, 2020 through December 31, 2020, please see <a href="/federal-eviction-moratorium-update/">our post on the federal moratorium</a>. For additional housing support resources, please visit <a href="https://justshelter.org/" target="_blank">JustShelter.org</a>. For more detailed information about statewide orders, please see the <a href="/covid-policy-scorecard">COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard</a>.

The Eviction Lab table only includes utility shutoff moratoria that have been ordered by an executive or legislative order. <a href="https://www.foodandwateraction.org/" target="_blank">Food & Water Action</a> is maintaining a database of all water shutoff policies, including those that are the utility's own policy or are mandated by pre-existing law. 

For activists and tenants looking to organize around housing issues in this troubling time, the <a href="https://www.antievictionmap.com/" target="_blank">Anti-Eviction Mapping Project</a> has created a <a href="https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/covid-19-map/" target="_blank">map of emergency housing policies</a> and actions in progress. 

A law clinic led by Emily Benfer, Visiting Associate Clinical Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, is also maintaining a detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTH8dUIbfnt3X52TrY3dEHQCAm60e5nqo0Rn1rNCf15dPGeXxM9QN9UdxUfEjxwvfTKzbCbZxJMdR7X/pubhtml#" target="_blank">database of legal orders</a> pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic. Legal aid attorneys are encouraged to reference this resource and to contact <a href="mailto:emily.benfer@law.columbia.edu">emily.benfer@law.columbia.edu</a> with any questions or additions.
