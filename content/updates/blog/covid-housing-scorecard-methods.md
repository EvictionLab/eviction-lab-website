**Introduction**

Safe and decent housing have always been central to ensuring health and stability. Today, with the United States focused on containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the broader issue of income and housing insecurity has quickly become paramount to the health of an entire nation. 
As a stopgap measure, state and local governments, as well as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have issued partial emergency eviction and foreclosure moratoriums to prevent families and individuals from losing their homes during the crisis. These emergency measures vary greatly in form and level of protection. While some of the moratoriums block evictions today, the vast majority still allow for widespread eviction as soon as state and federal emergency declarations expire. To prevent the deleterious health consequences of eviction and an escalating economic crisis, states are beginning to pursue strategies to ensure safe, decent, and stable housing during and after the pandemic. 
In order to evaluate state responses, the Eviction Lab and Columbia Law School’s Prof. Emily Benfer have developed a policy scorecard for each state, distilling the contents of thousands of newly-released emergency orders, declarations, and legislation into a clear set of critical measures included in, and left out of, state-level pandemic responses related to eviction and housing. 

Our Philosophy
Safe and decent housing drives the health and wellbeing of individuals, families, and communities across America. Prior to the pandemic, over 300,000 people faced eviction in a typical month and 2.8 million more were on the verge of eviction. Eviction leads to residential instability, moving to poor quality housing, overcrowding, and homelessness, all of which is associated with negative health outcomes among adults and children. 

Without robust housing supports and eviction moratoriums, these devastating outcomes will proliferate and multiply across the tens of millions of Americans facing unemployment in the economic downturn. These effects will be exacerbated among low-income people who were already chosing between paying for the rent and other necessaities and among people of color who are sujected to the consequences of discrimination and segregation in housing, on top of shortages. As states grapple with how to protect citizens during and in the recovery from the pandemic, this scorecard provides comprehensive information about the varying approaches state by state. To be certain, the short and long term supportive measures are not exhaustive and many more health protective housing strategies are available to states and local communities. 

Research Methodology 
The state scorecard documents the following categories and measures, which may be controlled by courts, governors, or legislatures (“state”):
 
Initiation of the eviction process: whether a state bars landlords from serving tenants with notice to quit and filing an eviction action, including cases of COVID-19-related hardship, nonpayment, or nonurgent other fillings.
Court actions: whether a state suspends eviction hearings, stays writs, orders, or judgements of possession, tolls or extends court deadlines, and seals eviction case records.
Removal of tenants: whether a state bars law enforcement from executing an eviction order, including cases of COVID-19-related hardship, nonpayment, or all non-emergency cases.
Short-term support for tenants: whether a state extends eviction moratoriums and emergency protections past the state of emergency, provides a grace period to pay rent, bars landlords from reporting tenants to credit bureaus, and halts foreclosures. In addition, the scorecard tracks whether utilities are barred from disconnecting service or are required to reconnect service without a fee, though these measures are not included in states' final scores because the state is not always the actor.
Support to preserve tenancy during and after the crisis: whether a state bars late fees, provides tenants with free legal representation in housing court, provides for safe and decent housing (through rental assistance or some other measure to provide relief from rental debt), and bars rent raises during and in the recovery from the pandemic.

To compile the state level research, we collect and analyze state governor emergency declarations, state legislation, and court orders on a daily basis. We also review court and attorney general memorandum and guidance. In addition, where possible, we consult with local attorneys to determine how the orders have been interpreted in the state. Because the pandemic response is evolvingchanging daily, so too is our research. We do not consider the scorecard results to be complete until after the public health crisis has ended. In this way, states' five-star ratings may rise or fall as existing protections expire or states adopt new protective measures.
 
In order to develop the scorecard, we consulted with housing and homelessness lawyers and advocates, tenant groups, and public health experts around the country. Based on these interviews, we assigned weights based on each category’s level of protection as it relates to not only in preventing evictions today, but securing safe, stable, and decent housing for tenants after the immediate crisis caused by COVID-19 has lifted. The two categories with the heaviest weights are “Initiation”--the first steps that a landlord takes to begin the eviction process--and “Tenancy Preservation Measures,” which includes a variety of measures that states can implement to support tenants and homeowners in staying in place during and following the COVID-19 crisis. 

The scorecard also includes figures for the number of renters in each state, who could be affected by the housing crisis, and links to other COVID-19 housing resources.

These questions will elevate housing insecurity in the national debate, ensuring that eviction--and the role of safe and decent housing as an instrument of health--is central to our collective conversation about inequality and wellbeing in America.

Measures

The COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard covers the entirety of the official eviction process, starting with the initial notice to the tenant and ending with enforcement of a court order by a law enforcement officer. It does not account for jurisdictions with legal self-help eviction. The eviction process described herein may also apply to hotels, motels, mobile homes, and homeless shelters, depending on state law. Additionally, the scorecard tracks a variety of short and long-term supportive measures that, if adopted, would help tenants and homeowners secure or maintain safe, stable and decent housing, like prohibiting utilities disconnections, halting foreclosure proceedings, or providing financial support. 

For each state, we track and analyze all state-wide orders that includewith measures pertaining to housing or court functions, including executive orders, judicial orders, and legislation. This means that for many states, the final score takes into account cumulative policies derived from multiple sourcesorders. A list of all orders that we consult is available here. On request, the Eviction Lab can provide an answer to which order provides a particular measure marked as "present" on our scorecard.

Generally, a measure must be included in a particular order to be marked as "present.," This means that if an order could have the effect of suspending a stage in the eviction process but does not clearly do so, and we do not count a measure as present if it is "in effect" in place because of a different measure. For example, if eviction filings are prohibited, it would logically follow that, in effect, a court cannot hold eviction hearings. However, a court that has not suspended civil or eviction hearings or trials could still consider eviction cases that were filed prior to the moratorium on filing. At the same time, The problem with in effect flows is that if the initial order expires, the subsequent measures that had relied on that first measure likely are now removed (in the example, if the prohibition on filings expires, now nothing bars the court from holding the eviction hearings). Eviction moratoriums are stronger, and more comprehensive, and easier for renters and property owners to understand if each phasemultiple parts of the eviction process isare clearly halted independent of one another. This is particularly true for parts of the process that are controlled by different actors. 

We permit two exceptions to the above rule. First, in the case of measures relating to filings and to enforcement, if a more comprehensive measure is taken, we also count the less-comprehensive measures as "present." Thus, if the state prohibits filings for any non-emergency reason, we also count as present the measure that filings are not permitted for reasons of nonpayment of rent and the measure that filings are not permitted for reasons of nonpayment of rent if the tenant has experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19 or the pandemic response. Second, we count as present measures that are "in effect" present because of a measure that has been directly ordered if the following two conditions are met: 1) the two measures are in the same category on the scorecard and 2) the "in effect present" measure proceeds chronologically after the in fact present measure in the five stages of eviction. Specifically, if landlords are not permitted to serve notices to quit to tenants, we also consider all filings-related measures to be in effect present, and if hearings are suspended in a state, we also consider the measure relating to judgements of possession to be present. 

The list of tracked measures, and the formula to convert measures into a five-star score, was developed by the Eviction Lab and Prof. Emily Benfer in consultation with a number of housing attorneys and advocates working across the country. A list of people and organizations who generously gave feedback on this tool is available in the "Acknowledgements" section of this report. 

Initiation: Eviction filings can prevent a tenant from securing new housing and credit, even if the court ultimately rules in the tenant's favor or dismisses the case. Therefore, it's important that landlords not be able to file to evict a tenant, even if other orders from the courts, executive, or law enforcement prevent the eviction from happening during the crisis. Additionally, states that allow landlords to file for eviction now could see all of those cases become "active" at once when the orders that restrict later parts of the eviction process expire. This could allow for mass evictions of tenants, and could overwhelm the court systems in some states. 

Measures in this category correspond to the first two stages of the five-stage eviction process. 

In the Initiation category, we track four types of measures:
Notice to tenants. In most states, a landlord must serve a tenant with a "notice to quit" prior to filing for eviction. This measure is marked as "present" if landlords are not able to serve notices to quit during the crisis.
No filing if tenant has COVID-19 hardship. This measure is marked as "present" if landlords are not able to file to evict tenants who are experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 or the pandemic response, or if courts are not accepting these filings. Note that orders that limit filing prohibitions to cases where tenants are financially affected by COVID-19 or the response to the pandemic leave many tenants unprotected. We include these orders, which are not on their face comprehensive of all tenants, on our scorecard because some advocates are successfully arguing that, in fact, enough tenants fall into this category that all filings should be halted. When advocates are successful in making this argument in a state, we count the following two measures as also present. 
No filing for nonpayment. This measure is marked as "present" if landlords are not able to file to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent, or if courts are not accepting these filings.
No filing, except emergencies. This measure is marked as "present" if landlords are not able to terminate rental agreements by filing to evict tenants for any non-emergency reason, or if courts are only accepting emergency eviction or landlord-tenant cases. 

Court Process: After a landlord notifies a tenant (if required by the state) and files an eviction case in court, the court process begins. In nearly all states, courts have limited civil proceedings during the pandemic. This should prevent courts from processing eviction cases and issuing eviction orders. Court orders vary, however, in how they address eviction cases specifically--some states prohibit people who work in the court system from participating in actions that would lead to a tenant's "ejectment," or removal, from a home; other states expressly suspend eviction hearings; some have stayed all eviction judgements, which temporarily prevents law enforcement officers from removing tenants from homes; still others have remained silent. 

Measures in this category correspond to the third and fourth of the five stages of eviction.  

In the Court Process category, we track four types of measures:
Hearings suspended. We count this measure as "present" if eviction hearings are suspended in the state. This can take a variety of forms, including suspending all non-essential civil proceedings and ordering court workers not to take actions that would lead to an eviction. On request, the Eviction Lab can provide a full list of types of orders that we count as present for this measure. Notably, we do not count this measure as present if non-essential cases are permitted to proceed remotely via phone or video conferencing and the state has not issued further guidance on whether eviction cases should proceed. 
Judgements of possession stayed. We count this measure as "present" if the court has stayed eviction judgements (which temporarily prohibits law enforcement from carrying out the eviction order) or if the court is not issuing eviction orders at this time. This measure is counted as present if hearings are not proceeding, because this means it is unlikely that a judgement could be entered. 
Deadlines extended or tolled. This measure refers to requirements for how quickly people need to respond to court summons. If deadlines are not tolled, tenants may need to pay fines, or may lose their right to a hearing. We count this measure as "present" if court deadlines are extended or tolled. 
Eviction records sealed. The COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented in American history, and millions of Americans could face eviction through no fault of their own as a result of the crisis. Sealing the court records from the pandemic would help tenants avoid some of the repercussions that follow an eviction judgement, like difficulty finding future housing. We count this measure as "present" if a state orders records from this time period to be sealed. 

Enforcement: This category refers to the final stage of eviction, when a sheriff or other law enforcement officer enforces the court's eviction order by ensuring that the tenant and the tenant's belongings are removed from the home. 

In the Enforcement category, we track three types of measures:
No removal if tenant has COVID-19 hardship. We count this measure as "present" if law enforcement is prohibited from removing a tenant whose eviction judgement was the result of COVID-19-related financial distress.
No removal of tenant for nonpayment. We count this measure as "present" if law enforcement is prohibited from removing a tenant whose eviction judgement was the result of nonpayment of rent.
No removal of tenant, except emergencies. We count this measure as "present" if law enforcement is prohibited from removing a tenant for any non-emergency reason. 

Short-Term Supports: This category refers to measures that, in the short term, will provide support to help tenants remain in their homes.

In the Short-Term Supports category, we track six types of measures:
Moratorium extends past emergency declaration. We count this measure as "present" if one or more of the statewide measures will remain in effect for a period of time after the emergency declaration ends. This extension would give tenants more time to get back on their feet, and would help prevent a wave of evictions when the immediate COVID-19 crisis ends.
No utility disconnection. Tenants must have basic utilities like electricity and water in order to safely stay in their homes. We count this measure as "present" if a state's regulatory body--often a public utilities commission--has issued a binding order that prohibits utilities from disconnecting service for reason of nonpayment, or if an executive or legislative order prohibits disconnecting service for reason of nonpayment. Because it is not possible in all states for the regulatory body to issue a binding order that applies to all utility companies in the state, this measure is not considered in the state's five-star rating. 
Free utility reconnection. In some areas where shutoffs are banned, residents whose service was disconnected before the pandemic began still have to pay a fee or pay existing past-due bills to have the water, electricity, or gas turned back on. We count this measure as "present" if utility companies are banned from disconnecting service and are required to restore service, or make all "reasonable efforts" to restore service, without charge to the tenant. Because it is not possible in all states for the regulatory body to issue a binding order that applies to all utility companies in the state, this measure is not considered in the state's five-star rating. 
Grace period to repay rent. We count this measure as "present" if the state requires landlords to allow tenants extra time to pay past-due rent. 
No report to credit bureau. If missed rental payments during the crisis are reported to credit bureaus, this could damage the credit of tenants who were financially affected by the COVID-19 crisis for years to come. Widespread reporting of missed payments during the COVID-19 crisis could also make it impossible for landlords to distinguish between tenants who missed rental payments due to the crisis and tenants who routinely do not fulfill financial obligations. We count this measure as "present" if the state prohibits landlords from reporting past-due rent or missed rental payments to credit bureaus.
Foreclosure moratorium. We count this measure as "present" if the state has halted one or more parts of the foreclosure process.

Tenancy Preservation Measures: This category refers to measures that provide longer-term relief to tenants, helping to keep tenants in safe, decent housing after the immediate COVID-19 crisis has passed.

No late fees. Late fees and convenience fees can significantly increase the amount of rental debt that a tenant must repay. Charging late fees could make it harder for tenants to catch up on rent owed after the crisis ends. We count this measure as "present" if landlords cannot charge late fees or convenience fees for rent paid after the due date or paid in multiple installments.
No rent raises. We count this measure as "present" if landlords cannot increase the rental amount when renewing a lease during the COVID-19 crisis.
Housing stabilization. When eviction moratoriums begin to expire, many tenants will have accrued significant amounts of rental debt over the course of the pandemic, through no fault of their own. We count this measure as "present" if states have passed any of a variety of orders that could reduce or cancel tenants' debt. Possible orders include: creating rental assistance programs that will pay tenants' past-due rent, freezing rent, detaching rental debt from tenancy and instead moving it to small claims court, or canceling rental debts. 
Legal counsel for tenants. With widespread confusion about what protections are and aren't available to tenants, 

Weighting and Scoring
Our scoring formula buckets measures by what part of the process the measure affects, then counts points--which appear on the website as a rating out of five stars--based on which types of measures states have enacted. Initiation measures account for two out of the five stars, Court Process measures account for half of a star, Enforcement of Eviction Order measures account for half of a star, Short Term Supports account for half of a star, and Tenancy Preservation Measures account for one and a half stars. A state with five stars, then, has statewide measures that halt each part of the eviction process and additionally provide supports that will help keep tenants in their homes, while a state with one or two stars might only block one part of the process. 

To calculate each state's Eviction Moratorium Score, we consider eviction-prevention measures in five stages: Initiation, Court Actions, Enforcement, Supportive Measures, and Measures to Preserve Tenancy. The first of these three categories 

The initiation of the eviction process (40%): Whether a state bars landlords from serving tenants with notice to quit their home and filing an eviction 
In cases of COVID-19-related hardship
Nonpayment
Nonurgent other fillings

Court Actions (10%): Whether a state
Suspended eviction hearings
Stays judgements by the court, or orders that eviction judgements not be issued
Tolls or extends court deadlines
Seals eviction cases

Enforcement, i.e. Removal of Tenants (10%): Whether a state bars enforcement of an eviction order in cases of 
COVID-19-related financial hardship
Nonpayment, or 
All non-emergency cases

Short-Term Supports for Tenants (10%): Whether a state
Extends emergency protections past the state of emergency
Provides a grace period to repay rent
Bars rent reporting to credit bureaus 
Halts foreclosures 

The scorecard additionally tracks whether utilities are barred from shutting off service or are required to reconnect service, though these measures are not included in states' final scores.

Support to preserve tenancy during and after the crisis: 30%
Whether a state bars late fees
Provides tenants with a right to counsel in housing court
Provides rental assistance (or some other measure to address relief of rental debt), and 
Bars rent raises for the duration of the pandemic.
