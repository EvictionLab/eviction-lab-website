As the world seeks to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers across the U.S. are responding to the heightened insecurity so many face.

This new table details where municipalities, states, and the federal government have taken action. We will be continually updating the table as we build a larger map to house this information, and <a href="https://evictionlab.org/contact/">welcome tips</a> regarding what your community is putting into place. 

Policymakers across America are implementing a wide range of supports, from placing a moratorium on all evictions, to more limited moratoria for residents who can demonstrate lost wages due to coronavirus.
