For three years, the Eviction Lab has set out to measure the prevalence, causes, and consequences of housing insecurity across America. 

As the world seeks to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers across the U.S. have responded to address the heightened insecurity, eviction, and homelessness so many are facing.

This new table outlines where municipalities, states, and the federal government have taken action. We will be continually updating the table as we build a larger map to house this information, and <a href="https://evictionlab.org/contact/">welcome tips</a> you may have regarding what your community is putting into place. 

Policymakers across America are implementing a wide range of supports. In some places, municipalities are placing a moratorium on all evictions, and in others, the moratorium only applies to residents who can demonstrate lost wages due to coronavirus.
