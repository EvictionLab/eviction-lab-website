### What to Expect from the Eviction Process


{{< faq 

"q1" 

"Are renters protected from eviction right now?"

"The CDC moratorium was extended until July 31st and protects eligible renters from eviction in nearly every part of the country (one exception is the <a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eviction-memphis-crisis-court-cdc-ban/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Western District of Tennessee</a>, which includes Memphis). Renters should provide a copy of the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>declaration form</a> to their landlord and in any eviction hearing. <a href='https://evictionlab.org/moratorium-extended-evictions-continue/'>More information about the federal moratorium, including who is covered by the moratorium, is available here</a>."

"Across the country, renters also have a constitutional right to due process, which means they have the right to be heard and can dispute an eviction in court. Although it is not common, in some specific places, tenants might have to post a bond--pay the rent that they owe to an account held by the court system--to get a hearing."

"There are at least four states—New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, Vermont and, also the District of Columbia among them—that have their own moratoria in place."

"Contact local housing advocates and <a href='https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>legal aid organizations</a> in your city or state to learn your rights, seek legal counsel and find the most up to date information. More legal aid providers can be found through <a href='https://iolta.org/program-directory/#us-programs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>state bar associations (associations of all attorneys in the state) and NAIP</a>. More legal assistance can be found from the American Bar Association and LawHelp.org. Find or post resources in your community to <a href='https://justshelter.org/community-resources/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>our sister website Just Shelter</a>."

"I have been unable to afford the rent, what can I do?"

"Billions of dollars in rental assistance funds are now available nationwide. Call 2-1-1 to learn more about how to apply for the rental assistance available in your area. Depending on where you live, these programs might be managed by a city, a county, a state or a non-profit. You can find hundreds of <a href='https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>rental assistance programs available in this list</a>."

"Apply for rental assistance as quickly as you can, since the process of getting the money may take weeks or months. If your landlord files to evict you while you are waiting to hear back about your application, be sure to let the court know that you have an application pending."

"Depending on the program in your area, your landlord might need to cooperate with the program, and the program will pay the rental assistance to the landlord or property management company directly. In other places, if your landlord does not cooperate with the program or send in required forms, the program will pay the tenant directly. If your landlord does not cooperate with the program, ask if it's possible for the assistance to be issued to you instead."

"I’ve already lost my home. Can I access rental assistance for a new place? Am I eligible for any other resources?"

"If you've already lost your home, call 2-1-1 or check <a href='https://justshelter.org' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Just Shelter</a> to find out about shelters, housing providers, and support available in your community. In some states, rental assistance programs are allowing funds to be used for relocation, and you could be eligible for other benefits. Also, veterans and active duty service members have certain rights in eviction and access to additional legal counsel. "

### Find a Lawyer

"How can I find a lawyer to help me understand my rights and defend against an eviction? "

"Renters may bring an attorney to represent them. Working with a housing attorney could strengthen a renter’s case. There are free legal services across the country. To apply, contact a <a href='https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>local legal aid office</a>. The following resources can help you find legal answers or legal representation in court:"


"<ul><li><a href='https://www.lsc.gov/about-lsc/what-legal-aid/get-legal-help' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Legal Services Corporation - List of legal aid offices</a></li><li><a href='https://www.lawhelp.org/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>LawHelp.org</a> - Interactive forms and list of legal aid offices</li><li><a href='https://iolta.org/program-directory/#us-programs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>National Association of IOLTA Programs - Find legal aid offices</a></li><li><a href='' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Free Legal Answers - Email-based legal answers from volunteer attorneys</a></li></ul>"

"Attorneys can help tenants raise defenses or ask the judge for more time (called requesting a continuance), or have the case sealed or dismissed. Renters should mention, regardless of whether they have an attorney, if they have a <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CDC declaration form</a> or have applied for rental assistance."

"If someone is evicted, they may be eligible for emergency rental assistance and housing counseling services to help identify and pay the rent in a new home."
