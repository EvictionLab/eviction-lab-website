Since the Eviction Lab’s inception, we’ve been in constant pursuit of a seemingly simple question: how many evictions take place in the United States each year? After countless hours of data collection and research, we are finally able to produce some of the first estimates of the national prevalence of eviction.

Below you will find a table that shows our current national estimates of eviction filings and evictions, as well as their respective rates. The numbers of evictions and filings listed tell you the total number of evictions and filings that appeared in our data in a given year. The eviction and filing rates tell you what percentage of renter occupied households experienced either an eviction or an eviction filing in a given year. 

We calculated rates by dividing each year’s eviction filings or evictions by the total number of renter occupied households and multiplying by 100 so that the rate was represented as a percentage. 

You may notice that the numbers of evictions and filings appear to increase over time while the rates remain fairly consistent. This is because both the total number of evictions and the total number of renting households in our data increased over time.

As the figures above show, our current data suggest there was roughly 1 eviction filing for every 17 renter households between 2000 and 2016. Approximately 1 in 40 renter households were evicted over this period. To put these numbers into perspective, at the peak of the financial crisis in 2010, <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/research/foreclosure-report/national-foreclosure-report-10-year.pdf" target="_blank">estimates suggest</a> slightly over one million foreclosures were completed nationally. By comparison, we see almost a million evictions against tenants every single year. The narrative on housing often focuses on displacement among homeowners, but our findings suggest that there is an ongoing epidemic of eviction and displacement in the renting market. As you’ll see from the graphs below, the national eviction and filing rates have remained consistent over time, with small declines over the last few years.

It is important to note that there are several places where we do not have all eviction records, including New York and California. More information about why can be found in our <a href="https://evictionlab.org/docs/Eviction%20Lab%20Methodology%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">Methodology Report</a>. As a result, our current national estimates of evictions and eviction filings underestimate the overall prevalence of both. Our data collection efforts are ongoing, and we will continue to update our estimates as we learn more.
