description: Documenting populations disproportionately at risk of eviction.
listSummary: Are Black and Latinx renters evicted at higher rates than their white counterparts? Are women renters evicted at higher rates than men? Is this true for all racial and ethnic groups? Answering these questions is central to addressing the long history of excluding women and communities of color from housing, banking, and credit opportunities in the U.S.

Women and people of color have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic fallout. The pandemic is exacerbating existing inequalities—particularly racial inequalities—in terms of employment, financial security, and health access and outcomes. Economic repercussions have fallen disproportionately on women. Sectors that employ large shares of women have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, and disruptions to daycares and schools have left mothers shouldering greater childcare responsibilities—at the expense of their careers.

In this brief, we analyze whether this deepening of racial and gender inequalities holds true of eviction risk as well. In previous work, we have demonstrated that landlords file for eviction against Black and Latinx renters—especially Black and Latinx women—at higher rates than against their white and male counterparts. The share of Black tenants receiving eviction filings is often far larger than their share of the renter population. Between 2012 and 2016, nearly one in every four Black renters lived in a county in which the Black eviction rate was more than double the white eviction rate. Black and Latinx women were also evicted in much higher numbers than Black and Latinx men. 

To analyze how the pandemic may be changing who faces the threat of eviction, we draw on data collected through the Eviction Tracking System (ETS). The ETS collects the records of eviction filings—the first step of the eviction process recorded by the civil courts—across sixteen cities and six full states. In each of these areas we also have equivalent historical eviction filing records. 

Eviction filings do not identify the race or gender of tenants who are facing removal. As such, we use well-validated statistical techniques to impute, on the basis of names and addresses listed on the court records, defendants’ race/ethnicity and gender. We do this for both historical data and for records collected since March 15th of this year, which allows us to compare patterns before and during the pandemic.

In Figure 1 we plot the share of eviction filings against Asian, Black, Latinx, and white individuals before and during the pandemic, as well as the share of all renters in those racial/ethnic groups. Prior to the pandemic, Black renters received a disproportionate share of all eviction filings: they made up 21% of all renters in ETS sites, but received 36% of eviction filings. They continue to be over-represented during the pandemic, receiving 35% of filings since March 15th. Asian, Latinx, and white renters were under-represented in eviction filings relative to their share of the renting population in pre-pandemic times. This remains true during the pandemic as well, although the share of filings against Latinx and white renters has increased slightly. For example, the share of filings against white individuals has increased from 43.3% to 43.9%, still well below their share of the renting population in this sample (54.1%).

With these data in hand, we calculated three statistics for every gender-by-race/ethnicity category:

The average renter faced a 4.1% eviction filing rate, and an eviction rate of 2.3%. Put another way, approximately one in 25 renters was threatened with eviction every year, and one in 40 was evicted. These rates varied considerably by race/ethnicity. 

- Black renters experienced the highest average rates of eviction filing (6.2%) and eviction judgement (3.4%). 
- By contrast, the average eviction filing rate among white renters was 3.4% and the average eviction rate was 2.0%. 
- Nearly one in four black renters lived in a county in which the black eviction rate was more than _double_ the white eviction rate. 

These patterns are reflected in Figure 2, which displays the distributions of filing rates (top panel) and eviction rates (bottom panel) for female and male renters by race/ethnicity.
