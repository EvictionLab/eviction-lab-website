<span class="dropcap green">F</span>or more than a decade, Curtis Hoff ran a Milwaukee real estate empire that rented run-down properties to tenants with few other options. Hoff entered the market around 2000, and by 2021—the year he sold off his properties—he owned over 700 units, predominantly in Milwaukee’s majority-Black north side. He purchased most of these properties through foreclosure sales during the Great Recession. 

As described in reporting by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Hoff and his staff routinely ignored tenants’ maintenance requests, refusing to deal with cockroach and rodent infestations and malfunctioning heat and plumbing. Hoff readily filed evictions when tenants fell behind on rent. This strategy made sense because eviction filings intimidate tenants, saddle them with fees, limit future housing options by damaging rental histories, and grant the landlord considerable legal power—even if no eviction is ever executed. Indeed, eviction was so central to Hoff’s business strategy that he gave his holding companies names beginning with the letter A, such as “Aardvark Properties,” to ensure they would be at the top of the docket in eviction court. 

In a research article published in the journal Criminology, we investigate the management practices of landlords like Hoff and the implications for tenants and communities. Focusing on the case of Milwaukee, we find that in addition to fostering housing insecurity and creating hazardous living conditions for their tenants, landlords who rely on these strategies also make their properties and neighborhoods less safe.

Most crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in a set of properties that are owned by a very small number of landlords. Specifically, the properties owned by only 1.9% of landlords are the sites of more than 50% of all assaults at rental properties between 2016 and 2018. Owners of these properties were also responsible for large numbers of eviction filings and housing code violations, suggesting that their extractive business practices were putting tenants in danger.

To show that these extractive strategies matter—that this pattern wasn’t just driven by landlords who happened to specialize in dangerous neighborhoods—we needed to go a step further. We developed a measure of landlords’ extractive management practices that reflects their rates of eviction filings and housing code violations. We tested whether more crimes occur in properties owned by landlords who score higher on this measure of extractive practices. Doing so, we control for a large set of property and neighborhood factors. 

All else equal, properties owned by landlords with a pattern of extractive management have dramatically higher rates of assault (Figure 1). Properties managed by extractive landlords also show higher levels of burglary, robbery, and other types of crime.

Note: Figure 1 shows the expected assault rates at four-unit properties with the same physical characteristics and neighborhood locations, but different types of landlords. Compared to properties owned by the average landlord, those managed by landlords with a history of extractive management have much higher assault rates, even after controlling for property and neighborhood characteristics.

What is it about the extractive landlord strategies that leads to more crime at these properties? First, run-down properties—places with faulty window locks, rickety doors, and malfunctioning lights—present ready opportunities for crimes like burglary. Second, frequent evictions undermine residential stability and neighborhood cohesion. It’s hard to develop trust or a sense of community—a key aspect in crime prevention—within a property or a neighborhood if people are constantly getting evicted. Third, neglectful landlords rarely visit their properties, and may be more likely to turn a blind eye to illegal activity. Fourth, these landlords more often rent to tenants who may be more likely to commit crimes and are turned away by other landlords. 

But this is not the story of a few “bad apple” landlords. Extractive management styles like Hoff’s are an inevitable consequence of these markets as currently configured. 

Tenants looking to rent in low-income markets often lack other housing options, making them a captive market. Landlords like Hoff are able to fill their properties, despite their neglect, because their tenants rarely have other places that will take them. At a time when eviction, financial precarity, and incarceration have become distressingly common, tenants with imperfect records represent a sizable customer base. These factors contribute to the enormous power disparities between extractive landlords and their tenants. Hoff and other landlords like him typically own hundreds of housing units yielding annual rental incomes in the millions of dollars, while their tenants typically live paycheck to paycheck. These landlords can afford to amass housing code fines without imperiling their bottom line, while tenants often avoid reporting violations out of fear of retaliatory eviction. 

Most of the tenants preyed upon by extractive landlords in Milwaukee are Black. Segregation and discrimination reduce housing options and make Black renters easier targets for extractive landlords. Black Americans are routinely forced to pay more for worse quality products, a dynamic that has been called the “Black tax.” This pattern has been documented in many types of purchases, from groceries to electronics, and clearly exists in the rental housing market as well. This exploitation is often justified by appeals to racist narratives. In the case of housing, this leads to claims that low-income Black tenants are responsible for the dilapidation of their own properties. For example, Hoff has claimed, of his properties, that, “A lot got beat up by the tenants. They would break every window. They were animals.”

Extractive landlord strategies don’t work everywhere. They are most viable in stigmatized neighborhoods, places avoided by those who have other options. In particular, we find that the level of crime within a neighborhood is one of the strongest predictors of extractive landlord management. In higher-crime neighborhoods, tenants are much more likely to report having chosen their housing as a last resort and to have unaddressed maintenance problems (Figure 2). This makes sense, since public safety is a key factor renters consider when choosing where to live. People who end up in high-crime areas are the ones with few alternatives.

This makes clear a vicious cycle: as neighborhoods become dangerous and undesirable, those with the ability to move out do so. Landlords with properties in these places turn to extractive strategies to exploit those who have no option but to stay. These strategies in turn increase the level of crime at their properties, further stigmatizing the neighborhood and incentivizing extractive strategies. 

What, then, could be done to disrupt this cycle? One idea is to outlaw the screening of tenants based on their eviction, credit, and criminal histories. Banning screening could increase renters’ housing options, reduce the power differential between them and their landlords, and force landlords to provide better services. But prohibiting official screening may well lead to other forms of discrimination.

Another potential solution is to increase housing code enforcement. Bolstering city agencies’ powers could help ensure that every tenant’s home meets a basic level of habitability. But, again, this could result in unanticipated consequences. Strictly enforced housing codes would increase exploitative landlords’ operating costs, and they may attempt to maintain existing levels of profit by raising rents, gentrifying their properties to attract a wealthier clientele, or converting their properties to other uses.
