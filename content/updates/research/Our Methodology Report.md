In recent years, renters’ housing costs have far outpaced their incomes, driving a nationwide affordability crisis. Current data from the American Housing Survey show that most poor renting families spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing costs. Under these conditions, 1 millions of Americans today are at risk of losing their homes through eviction.

An eviction occurs when a landlord forcibly expels a tenant from a residence. While the majority
of evictions are attributed to nonpayment of rent, landlords may evict tenants for a variety of
other reasons, including property damage, nuisance complaints, or lease violations. A formal
eviction occurs when a landlord carries out an eviction through the court system. Conversely, an
informal eviction occurs when a landlord executes an eviction without initiating a legal process.

For example, a landlord may offer a buyout or perform an illegal lock-out. Until recently, little
was known about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of eviction.

The Eviction Lab at Princeton University has collected, cleaned, geocoded, aggregated, and
publicized all recorded court-ordered evictions that occurred between 2000 and 2016 in the
United States. This data set consists of 82,935,981 million court records related to eviction cases
in the United States between 2000 and 2016, gleaned from multiple sources. It is the most
comprehensive data set of evictions in America to date.

These data allow us to estimate the national prevalence of court-ordered eviction, and to compare
eviction rates among states, counties, cities, and neighborhoods. We can observe eviction trends
over time and across geography, and researchers can link these data to other sources of
information.

The following report details the Eviction Lab’s methodology. For further information, please
