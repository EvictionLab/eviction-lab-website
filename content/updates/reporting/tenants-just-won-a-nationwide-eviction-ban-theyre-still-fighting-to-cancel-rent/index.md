listSummary: As another month of rent came due September 1, tenant organizers
  were greeted with a rare bit of good news. The Trump administration announced
  a sweeping moratorium on residential evictions through the end of the year,
  providing an unexpected 11th-hour reprieve to millions of renters who had run
  out of options.
