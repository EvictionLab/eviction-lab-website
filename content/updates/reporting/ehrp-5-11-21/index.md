listSummary: In San Francisco, Supervisors are taking an unusual tack. Just to cover tenantsâ€™ COVID-related rent debt accumulated from April through September 2020, their Budget and Legislative Analyst estimated the City would need about two to four times the $54 million allocated. With the national moratorium on evictions looming, and such high unmet need, in March the Supervisors passed a resolution asking giant corporate landlords to negotiate with their tenant associations and use their own financial resources to help their tenants.
