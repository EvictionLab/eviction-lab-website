No. Evictions can happen outside of the courtroom, as when landlords pay renters to leave or execute illegal lockouts. There is some evidence that “informal evictions” are more common than “formal”, court-ordered evictions. Informal evictions are not captured in our dataset. Moreover, while we have tried to collect every recorded court-ordered eviction case, going back to 2000, some records were unavailable. Some courts seal eviction cases; others have not archived data; still, others make recording eviction cases time-consuming and difficult.
