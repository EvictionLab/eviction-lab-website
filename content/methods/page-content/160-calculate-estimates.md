Despite aggregating more than 99 million eviction records and 30,000 county-level annual reports on eviction filings—representing an average of 2.6 million annual eviction filings—our records are still missing reliable data for counties that were home to 33% of renting households.

To overcome this challenge, we developed a statistical model that drew on different sources of data to estimate the annual prevalence of eviction filings and households threatened with eviction for the missing counties. This model is based on socioeconomic factors that are detailed in our [Methodology Report (PDF)](https://evictionlab.org/docs/Eviction_Lab_Methodology_Report_2022.pdf).

All estimates contain uncertainty. To express this uncertainty, the estimates are accompanied by minimum and maximum credible intervals. We have confidence that the true eviction filing rate lies between the minimum and maximum credible intervals. The narrower the interval, the more confidence we have in our estimate.
