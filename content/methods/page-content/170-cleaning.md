To create the best estimates, all data we obtained underwent a rigorous cleaning protocol. This included formatting the data so that each observation represented a household; cleaning and standardizing the names and addresses; and dropping duplicate cases. The details of this process can be found in the <a href="https://evictionlab.org/docs/Eviction_Lab_Methodology_Report_2022.pdf" target="_blank">Methodology Report (PDF)</a>.
