An eviction filing does not necessarily mean that the threatened household leaves its home. A common practice is what is known as “serial filing,” where a landlord issues a series of eviction filings against a single household. 

We created the households threatened rate so that we can clearly identify how many households annually receive at least one eviction filing. When calculating this rate, we looked at the number of households receiving an eviction filing per 100 renter households. The eviction filing rate (the number of filings per 100 renter households) is still available in our database, and this will measure the total of evictions filed, no matter how many happened to the same tenants.

We can use information in our case records to identify when a household receives multiple eviction filings in a given year. By counting the number of households who ever received a filing in a given year, we can calculate the households threatened rate. The eviction filing rate will always be higher than the households threatened rate.
