  <p>Safe, stable, and decent housing has always been central to ensuring health and stability. Today, with the United States focused on containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the broader and longstanding issue of income and housing insecurity has quickly become paramount to the health of an entire nation. The COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard tracked measures implemented by state governments to limit residential housing displacement during the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>TThe federal government implemented three additional eviction moratoria: the CARES Act, which expired in summer 2020, and the CDC's "Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19," which was in place from September 4, 2020 to July 31, 2021 and re-implemented in a more limited form from August 3, 2021 to October 3, 2021. More information about eligibility requirements for the CDC moratorium is available <a href="/federal-eviction-moratorium-update">in our post on the federal moratorium</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Rental assistance, including upwards of $46 billion in federally-funded aid, became available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by the middle of 2021 at the latest. Most states were accepting rental assistance applications at the end of the Scorecard study period. The rental assistance measure on the Scorecard is counted as present if rental assistance was available to renters throughout the state during a statewide eviction moratorium.
