<<<<<<< HEAD
    <p>Safe, stable, and decent housing has always been central to ensuring health and stability. Today, with the United States focused on containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the broader and longstanding issue of income and housing insecurity has quickly become paramount to the health of an entire nation.</p> 
    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have announced a federal eviction moratorium in effect starting 9/4/2020 and recently extended through 7/31/21. This follows the expiration of many state and federal orders, including the CARES Act. The CDC moratorium blocks landlords from evicting tenants who are currently not able to pay rent and do not have another safe housing option if they were to be evicted.</p>

    <p>Safe, stable, and decent housing has always been central to ensuring health and stability. During the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States, the broader and longstanding issue of income and housing insecurity quickly became paramount to the health of an entire nation.</p> 
    <p>The Eviction Lab and Wake Forest University Law Schoolâ€™s Professor Emily Benfer developed the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard to distill the contents of thousands of emergency orders, declarations, and legislation into a clear set of critical measures included in, and left out of, state-level pandemic responses related to eviction and housing. From April 20, 2020 to June 30, 2021, the Scorecard reported up-to-date information about emergency housing policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Beginning July 1, 2021, the Scorecard reverted to a static version that reports the most comprehensive eviction moratorium and emergency housing policy response implemented by each state between March 15, 2020 and June 30, 2021. The date listed for each place indicates the last day that the state received that score, before some or all of the measures expired. The date is listed as June 30, 2021 if the policies were in place when the Scorecard moved to this archival version.</p>

      The federal government also implemented two eviction moratoria: the CARES Act, which expired in summer 2020, and the CDC's "Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19," which ended on June 30, 2021. More information about eligibility requirements is available <a href="/federal-eviction-moratorium-update"> in our post on the federal moratorium</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Rental assistance, including upwards of $46 billion in federally-funded aid, became available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by the middle of 2021 at the latest. Most states were accepting rental assistance applications at the end of the Scorecard study period. The rental assistance measure on the Scorecard is counted as present if rental assistance was available to renters throughout the state during a statewide eviction moratorium.</p>
