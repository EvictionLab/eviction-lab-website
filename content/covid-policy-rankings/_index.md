    <p>In a world struggling to control a global pandemic, the importance of safe, stable, and decent housing is now central to preventing the spread of the virus itself.</p>  
    <p>State and local governments, as well as the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have issued partial emergency eviction and foreclosure moratoriums to prevent families from being ejected from their homes during the crisis. But these emergency measures vary greatly in form and level of protection. While some of the moratoriums block evictions today, most still allow for mass evictions as soon as states' emergency declarations expire. This ignores the rapidly growing housing crisis and its severe public health consequences.</p> 
intro2: >-
    <p>To address these questions, the Eviction Lab and Columbia Law Schoolâ€™s Prof. Emily Benfer have put together a policy scorecard for each state, distilling the contents of hundreds of newly-released legal documents into a clear set of critical measures of state responses.</p>
