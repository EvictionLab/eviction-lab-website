Since joining the Eviction Lab in 2022, Tasneem has managed day-to-day operations while taking on a wide range of design projects. She created educational materials for Poverty, by America, led the creation of an {{< extlink "antipoverty resource database" "https://endpovertyusa.org/" >}}, and regularly produces event photography and promotional materials for both lab and university events, including the wide-reaching Princeton Public Lectures series. Before joining the Eviction Lab, Tasneem worked at UCSF’s Hollenbach Lab, researching immune system links to health outcomes like COVID-19 severity. She holds degrees in Bioinformatics from The University of Chicago and Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley.

Tasneem is from Nairobi, Kenya and speaks five languages, currently working hard to level up her Spanish. When not working, she is consumed by her ever-growing repertoire of hobbies—sewing, crochet, origami, embroidery, painting, photography, resin art, singing and guitar.
