Tasneem joined the Eviction Lab as a Program Coordinator in 2022. She received her master’s degree in Biomedical Informatics from The University of Chicago, and her bachelor’s degree in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley. At the worker’s collective Berkeley Free Clinic, she provided free hepatitis/HIV testing and counseling to underserved community members, and became strongly opposed to health care delivery as a profit-making industry. Before joining the Eviction Lab, she worked in the Hollenbach Lab at UC San Francisco as a programmer and researcher, processing DNA samples in order to study the association between components of the immune system and varied health outcomes such as COVID-19 symptom severity. At the Eviction Lab, Tasneem hopes to participate in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of eviction-related data to make compelling arguments for policy change that will help alleviate poverty. 

Tasneem loves to be taken for walks by her dog, crochet and sew (clothing items for said dog to inevitably reject), salsa dance (clumsily), and sing with her choir, Princeton Pro Musica.
