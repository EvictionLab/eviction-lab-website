Her passion for addressing social and income inequalities has taken her around the world in pursuit of the data and stories that can move policy and culture forward. She writes and leads media strategy for The Eviction Lab in partnership with the Economic Hardship Reporting Project. Alieza gained a decade of experience as a writer and researcher of the intersections of gender, work, and social policy, most recently at the think tank New America, as a Senior Policy Analyst at the Better Life Lab program.

To improve coverage of work, gender, and care issues, she also launched a year-long dedicated Better Life Lab vertical at Slate magazine. Alieza has led media impact and strategy for a team of investigative reporters at the Fuller Project for International Reporting, reported on health care access and the peace process in Colombia, researched segregation effects in a U.S. context, lived and studied human rights in Chile, and researched EU implementation from Germany, where she lived for three years and got her Masterâ€™s in Public Policy.
