Carl Gershenson is Lab Director at Eviction Lab. He has published on the causes and consequences of housing instability, with a special focus on how eviction leads to further economic and residential insecurity. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology from Harvard University, where his dissertation explored the political and cultural origins of the American business corporation. After graduation, Carl joined the Sociology Department at Washington University in St. Louis as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.

At the Eviction Lab, Carl will continue to study how American political economy creates the conditions for the contemporary housing crisis. He is also deeply interested in issues around climate and energy, and he will work these interests into his research at Eviction Lab. When life gives him the chance, Carl likes to read history and fiction and explore Philadelphia.
