Olivia graduated from Middlebury College where she majored in Economics and minored in Mathematics. As an undergraduate, she worked as a research assistant examining how economic hardships experienced by Russians during the post-communist transition in Russia affected their attitudes toward market reforms and different policies. For her undergraduate thesis, she used a longitudinal survey data from Russia to examine the impacts of self-perceived economic welfare on life satisfaction, and its implications on income inequality. As a researcher, she is interested in delving deeper into the problems of poverty and inequality. A South Korean raised in Hong Kong, Olivia loves traveling, exploring new places to eat, drawing, and taking long walks.
