Peter is an {{< extlink "assistant professor of Sociology at Rutgers University-Newark" "https://sasn.rutgers.edu/about-us/faculty-staff/peter-hepburn" >}}. Peter first joined the Eviction Lab in 2018 as a postdoc after completing his PhD in Sociology and Demography at the University of California, Berkeley. At the Lab, he has done work on [serial eviction filings](https://evictionlab.org/serial-eviction-filings/), [racial and gender disparities in eviction rates](https://evictionlab.org/demographics-of-eviction/), eviction in suburban spaces, gentrification and eviction, and money judgments in eviction cases. He also developed and leads the [Eviction Tracking System](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/). Outside of the Lab, Peterâ€™s research examines the ways that employment practices and public policies affect children and low-income families. He has also studied the effects of mass imprisonment on kin networks, exposure to subfelony criminal justice in New York City, and trajectories of employment and disability among American workers. Peter runs one marathon a year and no, he has not qualified for Boston (thank you for asking). You can read more about him at {{< extlink "pshepburn.github.io" "http://pshepburn.github.io/" >}}.
