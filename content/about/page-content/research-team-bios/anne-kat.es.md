Anne Kat is a recent graduate of Brandeis University, where she received a BA in English and Creative Writing. She is the Faculty Assistant in the Eviction Lab. Her bachelor's thesis considered issues of chronic low mood and hopelessness in early modern poetry, which may be why she sticks to reading murder mysteries and YA these days. Since arriving in the Northeast from Austin, Texas, she has discovered the season of fall. Four years later, it continues to surprise and impress her.
