Carl Gershenson is broadly interested in how markets and politics structure inequality in the United States. He received his Ph.D. in Sociology from Harvard University, where his dissertation explored the political and cultural origins of the American business corporation. As a graduate student, Carl published on a variety of topics, including corporate democracy and securities law, neighborhood level politics and the distribution of city services, and eviction and urban labor markets (with Matthew Desmond). After graduation, Carl joined the Sociology Department at Washington University in St. Louis as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, where he collaborated with Professor Tim Bartley on a project exploring how xenophobia and attitudes toward markets structure public opinion regarding immigration and offshoring.


At the Eviction Lab, Carl will continue to study how American political economy creates the conditions for the contemporary housing crisis. He is also deeply interested in issues around climate and energy, and he will work these interests into his research at Eviction Lab. When life gives him the chance, Carl likes to read history and fiction and explore Philadelphia.
