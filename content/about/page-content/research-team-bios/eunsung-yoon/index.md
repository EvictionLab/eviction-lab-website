Eunsung Yoon received her PhD in Sociology with a Minor in Information Science, as well as a Certificate in Computational Social Science from the University of Arizona. She earned her MA and BA from Korea University. Her research interests lie in understanding how specific strategies diffuse among market competitors, and how market actors make decisions about whom to monitor in situations of uncertainty. She employs an inductive approach to build sociological models, utilizing a diverse range of machine learning techniques such as geographically weighted neural networks and satellite-based mapping. At the Eviction Lab, she delves into examining how the structure of the rental market and the pricing strategies of individual landlords have changed over time, focusing on the increasing influence of investor landlords, online real estate platforms, and pricing recommendation algorithms.
