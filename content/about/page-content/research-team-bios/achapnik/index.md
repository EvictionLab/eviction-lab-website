Adam Chapnik (Research Specialist): Adam graduated from Vassar College where he majored in Quantitative Political Science and minored in Political Philosophy. As an undergraduate, he worked as a research assistant analyzing social network dynamics among officials within the Chinese government in order to understand how loyalty and competency have related to promotions. He also worked with a group of down-ballot Democratic candidates in southern Minnesota through Bluebonnet Data, leading a group of volunteers examining the rate and causes of ticket-splitting in the region to help the candidates to better target swing voters. As a researcher, he is interested in expanding his knowledge of quantitative techniques to discover hidden patterns in renting, evictions, and inequality. Originally from New England, Adam enjoys backpacking and canoeing, ceramics, and learning how to cook new foods.
