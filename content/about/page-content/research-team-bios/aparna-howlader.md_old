Aparna completed her Ph.D. at the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her dissertation research studies the relationship between land conservation policies and economic development. A large part of her current research is devoted to studying the extent to which early land conservation policies in the USA affect later economic and environmental conditions in the Great Plains. More broadly, her research interests include how urban and rural land policies affect inequality. Her research combines methods and theories from environmental economics, economic history, and development economics with modern empirical strategies.
