Lavar Edmonds is a research specialist with the Eviction Lab. Guided by experiences as a high school math teacher, his research broadly centers around inequality, particularly in education. In college, he worked as the data analyst for the school’s Student Transition Program, studying academic outcomes for first-generation and traditionally underrepresented minority students at the university. While at Penn, Lavar worked as a research assistant at the School District of Philadelphia and conducted a semester-long research project examining the causes of teacher exit in Tulsa Public Schools. His current research explores the impact of teachers from Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs) on student achievement. As part of the Eviction Lab team, he is especially interested in studying the intersection of housing policy – namely, causes and consequences of housing instability – with education policy. Beyond policy research, Lavar is a classically-trained violinist, and enjoys music performance and rousing, relatively slow-paced games of tennis. Originally from Norfolk, Virginia, Lavar studied economics and mathematics at the University of Mary Washington and education policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
