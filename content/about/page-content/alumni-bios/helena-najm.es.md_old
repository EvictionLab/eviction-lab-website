Helena received her HBSc from the University of Toronto in 2017, and graduated from Columbia University's MA in Global Thought program in 2019. She has worked at the nexus of health, politics and social inequality in academic and public service capacities, and is broadly interested in researching social welfare policy, urban inequality, citizenship and social stratification. Her extra-academic life consists of roaming around New York, drinking bodega iced coffee and sketching.
