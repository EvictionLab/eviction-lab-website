Scott Overbey is a junior in the Economics Department at Princeton University pursuing certificates in Statistics/Machine Learning, Political Economy, and Urban Studies. His research interests generally cover poverty, housing, and public finance in the United States and what government, specifically at a local level, can do to address social ills. As a proud Cincinnati native, he hopes to use this research to impact local policy making in his hometown. Outside of the Lab, Scott is an Assistant Residential College Advisor in Butler College, Captain of the Model United Nations Team, and a Junior Fellow for the Pace Center's Service Focus Program.
