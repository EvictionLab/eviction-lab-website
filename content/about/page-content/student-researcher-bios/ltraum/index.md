Lauren is a student at Bowdoin College majoring in philosophy and minoring in math. Prior to interning at the Eviction Lab, she worked as a field organizer for the Warnock-Ossoff Runoff Campaign and as a coordinator for Bowdoin Cultural Immersion Orientation Trips. Lauren became interested in data visualization upon taking a U.S. history class involving GIS mapping analysis. At the Eviction Lab, she is excited to research and visualize how homeowners and renters experience differing governmental economic support through tax deductions and subsidies.

In her free time, Lauren enjoys listening to podcasts, working on photography projects, and going on long-distance runs.
