Katherine is a first-year student in the School of Public and International Affairs. She hopes to pursue a minor in Korean Language and a certificate in Entrepreneurship. Her prior internship experiences involve an investigation on the district-level impact of key issues in the 2022 NJ-08 Democratic primary race, such as Medicare for All, housing insecurity, and the abolishment of qualified immunity. She has also previously worked as a legal intern.

At the lab, Katherine plans to assist in conducting research on the complex cause-and-effect relationship underlying the response of housing costs and eviction rates to recent macroeconomic trends. She hopes to generate insightful and accessible findings that will serve to elevate the issue of housing insecurity to the forefront of policy discussions aimed at remediating residential security.

Outside of the lab, Katherine currently serves as a member of both the Output subteam for Princeton’s Entrepreneurship Club and Princeton’s Women in Entrepreneurship. She is also an Opinion writer for The Daily Princetonian and is  involved in the Princeton Pre-Law Society, Asian-American Students Association, and Korean-American Students Association.
