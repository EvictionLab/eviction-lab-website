Ronnie Clevenstine is a doctoral student in Sociology and Social Policy at Princeton University, affiliated with the Princeton Office of Population Research. Her research primarily focuses on poverty, rural populations, property insurance, and the social safety net. She is particularly interested how climate risk and state policy environments shape community well-being and exploitation in rural areas and the American South.

Prior to starting at Princeton, she received her BS in Economics from Clemson University and worked as a mixed-methods research assistant at a social policy research firm, where she conducted research on social insurance and safety net restriction at the federal and state level.
