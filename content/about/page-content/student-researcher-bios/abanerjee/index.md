Asha Banerjee is a doctoral student in the Population Studies and Social Policy program at Princeton University. She graduated with a B.A. in Economics and History from Columbia University and a Master of Philosophy in Economic and Social History from the University of Oxford. Prior to Princeton, Asha worked as an economic analyst in the Chief Economist’s Office at the U.S. Department of Labor and the Economic Policy Institute. Asha’s research interests focus on labor, unions, and the historical development and persistence of racial disparities and structural inequality in the economy. She hopes to analyze the roles migration and demographic change play, as well as the power and limitations of government and other institutional interventions. In her free time, you can find her at the Princeton Garden Theater or Labyrinth Books.
