Max is a doctoral student in Sociology and Social Policy at Princeton. Their current research projects examine the causes of rising corporate ownership of residential property, the racial structure of financial bubbles, and exploitation in housing markets.

They are interested more broadly in property ownership, wealth inequality, and economic sociology, as well as causal inference and machine learning.

Prior to Princeton, Max graduated from Columbia University in 2018 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in philosophy, focusing on 20th-century German and French social thought. After graduating, they worked for two years as a legal advocate for low-income New Yorkers with severe illnesses and disabilities, helping clients restore their housing stability, access food and healthcare, and keep their families together through administrative litigation against government agencies.
