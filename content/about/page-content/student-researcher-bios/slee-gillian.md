Gillian Slee is a first-year doctoral student in Sociology and Social Policy at Princeton University. She graduated from Harvard College in 2016 with a degree in Social Studies and a minor in Psychology. In 2017, Gillian earned her M.Phil. degree in Criminology at the University of Cambridge where she was a Herchel Smith Harvard Scholar. For her undergraduate thesis, she conducted an ethnographic study of public defenders and their clients in New York City’s criminal courts. Her master’s thesis explored legitimacy and legitimation in the British context and investigated how power-holders justified their authority in magistrates’ court. Gillian’s current research focuses on urban poverty, criminal justice, policy, and ethnography. At the Eviction Lab, Gillian is exploring the consequences of eviction on various neighborhood-level outcomes, including voting.
