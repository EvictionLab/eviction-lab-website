# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Richmond is divided into 36 zip codes. In each of those zip codes, we map eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over the that period, there have been steep declines in eviction filings across the city, with the exception of the Tuckahoe area.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were highest in majority-Black neighborhoods. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and  filings in 2016.
