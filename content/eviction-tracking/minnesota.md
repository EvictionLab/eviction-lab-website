Eviction filings in Minnesota have been significantly below average since a state-wide eviction moratorium was instituted in March 2020. Eviction protections remained in effect through the remainder of the year and were extended into 2021. The moratorium had been renewed each month until June 2021, after which the state [began phasing out protections](https://nlihc.org/resource/minnesotas-eviction-moratorium-ramp). 

More detail on eviction protections in Minnesota can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mn/). A closer look at eviction filing patterns in the Twin Cities is [available here](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/minneapolis-saint-paul-mn/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Minnesota is divided into 87 counties. In each of those counties, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
