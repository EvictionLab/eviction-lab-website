{{< report_intro id="12103" data="/uploads/table.csv" >}}

Eviction filings in Tampa—Hilllsborough and Pinellas Counties, FL—fell sharply during the early months of the pandemic. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. Regardless, new eviction filings increased by August 2020.

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/fl/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and beyond. We analyzed eviction records in Tampa (Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties) to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated quarterly.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Pinellas and Hillsborough counties are divided into 567 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
