Eviction filings in Tampa—Hilllsborough and Pinellas Counties, FL—fell sharply during the early months of the pandemic. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until no earlier than October 1. Regardless, new eviction filings have increased markedly since early August.

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/fl/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Tampa ran very close to historical averages in January and February of 2020.<sup>1</sup> They began to drop in March, and were low—running near or below a quarter of average—from April through July. They have increased markedly since the state eviction moratorium ended in late July.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Pinellas and Hillsborough counties are divided into 567 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in Tampa are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2016–2019.
