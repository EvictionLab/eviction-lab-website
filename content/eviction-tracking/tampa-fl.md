Eviction filings in Tampa—Hilllsborough and Pinellas Counties, FL—fell sharply during the early months of the pandemic. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until no earlier than October 1. Regardless, new eviction filings have increased markedly since early August.

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/fl/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Tampa ran very close to historical averages in January and February of 2020.<sup>1</sup> They began to drop in March, and were low—running near or below a quarter of average—from April through July. They have increased markedly since the state eviction moratorium ended in late July.

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Tampa (Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties) to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated monthly.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Pinellas and Hillsborough counties are divided into 567 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in Tampa are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. In March and April 2020, eviction filings began to drop across all neighborhoods, though they have more recently increased closer to historical averages. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
