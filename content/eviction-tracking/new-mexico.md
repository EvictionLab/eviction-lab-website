Eviction filings in Bernalillo County, NM (Albuquerque) have fallen sharply since mid-March 2020. While eviction filings and hearings have been allowed to proceed, on March 24, 2020, the New Mexico Supreme Court implemented a stay on the execution of writs for nonpayment of rent. This order remains in effect until it is amended or withdrawn.
