# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Tarrant and Denton counties are divided into 494 Census tracts. Here we map, in each of those tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see  declines in eviction filings across the city, though also pockets of higher-than-average filings, especially South of downtown.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods with no racial majority. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2018-2019.
