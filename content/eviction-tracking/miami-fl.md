Eviction filings in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties fell sharply in early 2020. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. 


More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard.
