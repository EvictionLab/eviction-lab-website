Eviction filings in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties fell sharply in early 2020. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. 

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties are divided into 1,219 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>


We are unable to assign many cases from prior to 2020 in Miami-Dade County to a census tract due to missing street address information. As a result, the “Relative to Average” tab in Miami-Dade County census tracts will not be shaded.
