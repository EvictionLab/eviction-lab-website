Eviction filings in Miami-Ft. Lauderdale fell sharply in early 2020. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. 

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard.

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In this barplot, we show the distribution of eviction filings over the last year by neighborhood racial/ethnic majority.  

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2014–2019.<sup>1</sup>

We are unable to assign many cases from prior to 2020 in Miami-Dade County to a census tract due to missing street address information. As a result, the “Filings Relative to Average” tab in Miami-Dade County census tracts only reflects data in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties are divided into 1219 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
