Eviction filings in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties fell sharply in early 2020. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. 

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2014–2019.<sup>1</sup>

We are unable to assign many cases from prior to 2020 in Miami-Dade County to a census tract due to missing street address information. As a result, the “Filings Relative to Average” tab in Miami-Dade County census tracts only reflects data in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.
