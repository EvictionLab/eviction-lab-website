{{% report_intro id="39061" data="/uploads/table.csv" %}}















The state of Ohio did not put a general eviction moratorium in place, but courts in Hamilton County (Cincinnati) suspended proceedings between March 19 and June 1, 2020. Eviction filings were accepted throughout this period, but fell in mid-March and April. Filings have since slowly risen closer to historical averages. 

On April 1, 2021, The Hamilton County Municipal Court stopped enforcing the national CDC moratorium, allowing for evictions for nonpayment of rent that may have been previously stayed.

More detail on eviction protections in Ohio can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/oh/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Cincinnati to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated quarterly. The most recent update for Cincinnati was in December 2021.

# Changes in claim amounts

When a landlord files an eviction claim in Cincinnati, we observe the amount they claim the tenant owes in back rent, late fees, and damages. In this figure, we plot the typical (median) amount claimed in eviction filings for each month since January 2020. We exclude cases in which the landlord doesn’t make a monetary claim, and we drop months if there were fewer than 10 eviction cases filed.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Cincinnati is divided into 222 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2012–2016.<sup>1</sup>
