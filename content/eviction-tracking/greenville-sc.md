South Carolina implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 17 and May 14, 2020. In both Greenville (Greenville County) and [Charleston](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/charleston-sc/), this period saw almost no new eviction filings. New case filings increased after the moratorium lifted. 

More detail on eviction protections in South Carolina can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/sc/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and beyond. We analyzed eviction records in Greenville to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated quarterly.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Greenville County is divided into 111 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
