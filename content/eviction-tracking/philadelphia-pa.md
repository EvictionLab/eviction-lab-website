The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31st. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period, and filings in Philadelphia County were down to zero in April, May, and June. Filings increased markedly following the end of the moratorium. 

More detail on eviction protections in Philadelphia can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/pa/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Philadelphia County is divided into 384 Census tracts. Here we map, in each of those tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, there have been tracts across the county with above-average counts of eviction filings.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. From March onwards, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though are rebounding fastest in majority-Black neighborhoods. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2019.
