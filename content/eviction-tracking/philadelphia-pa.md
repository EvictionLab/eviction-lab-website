The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31, 2020. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period, and filings in Philadelphia County were down to zero in April, May, and June. Filings increased following the end of the moratorium. Execution of eviction orders are generally banned until at least May 16, 2021.

As of April 1, 2021, Philadelphia landlords must apply for rental assistance, enroll in the city's eviction diversion program, and then wait 45 days before filing for eviction for non-payment of rent. 

More detail on eviction protections in Philadelphia can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/pa/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Philadelphia County is divided into 384 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. From March onwards, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though filing counts are rebounding fastest in majority-Black neighborhoods. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
