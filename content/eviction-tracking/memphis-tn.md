The state of Tennessee implemented an eviction moratorium that ran from March 13 to June 1, 2020, and courts in Shelby County (Memphis) were closed until June 15. During this period, new eviction filings were still allowed. The rate of new filings picked up after the moratorium lifted.

More detail on eviction protections in Tennessee can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/tn/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Memphis (Shelby County) to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Shelby County is divided into 221 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in Memphis are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-Black. Since March 2020, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods, though they have more recently increased back closer to historical averages. Majority-Black neighborhoods continue to see the largest number of eviction filings. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
