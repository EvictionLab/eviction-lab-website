New York state has taken a number of steps to prevent a surge in eviction cases. While the state-wide moratorium on eviction filings lifted on June 20th, additional protections—including the [Tenant Safe Harbor Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8192/amendment/b) and the    [automatic suspension of newly-filed eviction cases](http://nycourts.gov/whatsnew/pdf/ao160a20.pdf)—have helped to keep filings below historical average. The execution of writs of eviction on cases filed prior to the pandemic has also been [suspended until at least January, 2021](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-moratorium-covid-related-residential-evictions-will-be-extended-until).

More detail on eviction protections in New York can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/ny/) and from the [Furman Center](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/data-update-eviction-filings-in-nyc-since-covid-19).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

New York City is divided into 299 zip codes. In each of those zip codes, we map eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see declines in eviction filings across almost all of the five boroughs.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize zip codes by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, evictions in New York City were concentrated in majority-Latinx zip codes. Since the end of the state moratorium, those zip codes have also seen the largest number of new filings. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of zip codes defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2016–2018.
