New York has taken a number of steps to prevent a surge in eviction cases. A state-wide moratorium prevented landlords from filing eviction cases from late-March until June 20, 2020. Additional protections—including the [Tenant Safe Harbor Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s8192/amendment/b) and the [automatic suspension of newly-filed eviction cases](http://nycourts.gov/whatsnew/pdf/ao160a20.pdf)—have helped to keep filings below historical averages. A state-wide moratorium was again implemented in late-December. Pieces of the state-wide moratorium that allowed tenants to avoid a court case by declaring a COVID hardship were struck down by the Supreme Court in August 2021, but a new moratorium was enacted on September 2 that still affords tenants certain protections in cases of COVID hardship. 

More detail on eviction protections in New York can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/ny/) and from the [Furman Center](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/data-update-eviction-filings-in-nyc-since-covid-19).

# Changes in claim amounts

When a landlord files an eviction claim in New York, we observe the amount they claim the tenant owes in back rent, late fees, and damages. In this figure, we plot the typical (median) amount claimed in eviction filings for each month since January 2020. We exclude cases in which the landlord doesn’t make a monetary claim, and we drop months if there were fewer than 10 eviction cases filed.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

New York City is divided into 299 zip codes. In each of those zip codes, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize zip codes by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, evictions in New York City were concentrated in majority-Latinx zip codes. After the end of the first state moratorium in June 2020, those zip codes continued to see the largest number of new filings. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of zip codes defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2018.<sup>1</sup>
