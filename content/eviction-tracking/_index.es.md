intro: "The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened America’s housing crisis. The
  nation’s most severe public health emergency in a century may cause large
  spikes in eviction and homelessness. In response, we have created the Eviction
  Tracking System to monitor weekly updates on the number of eviction cases
  being filed across the United States. Scroll down to view full reports on the
  cities in which we are operating, and to learn more about the project. "

  ## A Looming Eviction Crisis


  Current policy responses to the pandemic may be insufficient to prevent a surge in evictions. CARES Act stimulus payments and unemployment insurance--when accessible--will provide families with some support, but in many cases not enough to make ends meet. Some states have passed temporary eviction moratoria, which the Eviction Lab is tracking in the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard, and localities across the country have introduced additional measures. Once these measures expire, however, millions of renters will owe significant amounts of back rent. For many, a displacement and eviction crisis will follow the public health crisis. 


  There is currently no data infrastructure that allows policymakers, legal and advocacy organizations, journalists, academics, and community members to track displacement and evictions in real time. The Eviction Lab has built the Eviction Tracking System (ETS) to fill this critical gap and to help monitor and respond to eviction hotspots as they emerge. The ETS is designed as a multi-site, open-source, and expandable system for tracking eviction filings as they happen. 


  We welcome feedback, as well as partnerships with states and localities who wish to work with us in monitoring and responding to emerging eviction hotspots. Ensuring housing security is vital to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and sustaining health, economic security, and family stability.

  ### Where's my city?


  The U.S. government does not collect eviction data, and most state governments don’t either. Instead, eviction records are housed within county court systems and can be very difficult to access. The cities represented in the ETS are cities that have the data infrastructure that allow us to track evictions on a weekly basis. We will continue to add more cities as the project develops. We also welcome opportunities to collaborate with local officials and clerks to make this data available.
