Eviction filings in Connecticut have been significantly below average since a state-wide eviction moratorium was instituted in April 2020. Eviction protections generally remained in effect through the remainder of the year and were extended into 2021, though some protections expired at the end of August 2020. 

More detail on eviction protections in Connecticut can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/ct/). Additional information is available on eviction filing patterns in [Bridgeport](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/bridgeport-ct/) and [Hartford](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/hartford-ct/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Connecticut is divided into eight counties. In each of those counties, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup>
