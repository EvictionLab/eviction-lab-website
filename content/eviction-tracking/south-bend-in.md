The state of Indiana implemented an eviction moratorium that ran from March 19 to August 14, 2020. Courts in St. Joseph County (South Bend) have been accepting new eviction filings and processing cases since that moratorium lifted.

More detail on eviction protections in Indiana can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/in/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

St. Joseph County is divided into 75 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in South Bend are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March 2020, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods, though they have increased back closer to historical averages in recent months. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
