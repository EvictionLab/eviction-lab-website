The state of Indiana implemented an eviction moratorium that ran from March 19 to August 14. Courts in St. Joseph County (South Bend) have been accepting new eviction filings and processing cases since that moratorium lifted.

More detail on eviction protections in Indiana can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/in/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

St. Joseph county is divided into 75 Census Tracts. In each of those tracts, we map eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see declines in eviction filings across most the city, though a few neighborhoods on the edge of the county with above-average filings.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in South Bend are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2016–2019.
