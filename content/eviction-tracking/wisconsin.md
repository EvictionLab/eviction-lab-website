Eviction filings in Wisconsin fell sharply once Governor Tony Evers blocked the initiation of non-emergency eviction proceedings on March 27, 2020. Eviction protections in Wisconsin began to expire on May 26, 2020, after which filings increased.

 A closer look at eviction filing patterns in Milwaukee County is available [here](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/milwaukee-wi/).

Filing counts in some counties for baseline years may differ slightly compared to court-released aggregates in Wisconsin. In particular, Chippewa, Douglas, Fond du Lac, La Crosse, Marathon, Rock, St. Croix, and Waukesha Counties are slightly underestimated in at least one of the three years compared to court aggregate data, while Eau Claire and Outagamie Counties see overestimates. Please see [here ](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/methods/)for more information on our validation procedures.

# Trends in eviction filings

This plot shows monthly eviction filings in Wisconsin were higher than average in January and February of 2020. That pattern reversed in March, and filings over the last year. Filings are displayed relative to the pre-pandemic average for the same set of months. You can toggle the plot to display filing counts and to extend the time frame back to January 2020.<sup>1</sup>

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Wisconsin is divided into 72 counties. In each of those counties, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

1. Eviction filing data were collected by [January Advisors](https://www.januaryadvisors.com/). Historical averages were taken from Eviction Lab data and cover the years 2016-2018.
2. County breakdown of renter race/ethnicity determined using American Community Survey (ACS) estimates for 2015–2019.
