Eviction filings in Wisconsin fell sharply once Governor Tony Evers blocked the initiation of non-emergency eviction proceedings on March 27, 2020. Eviction protections in Wisconsin began to expire on May 26, 2020, after which filings increased.

More detail on eviction protections in Wisconsin can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/wi/). A closer look at eviction filing patterns in Milwaukee County is available [here](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/milwaukee-wi/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Wisconsin is divided into 72 counties. In each of those counties, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
