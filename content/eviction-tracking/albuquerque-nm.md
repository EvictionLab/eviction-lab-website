Eviction filings in Bernalillo County, NM (Albuquerque) fell sharply in early 2020. While eviction filings and hearings were allowed to proceed, on March 24, 2020, the New Mexico Supreme Court implemented a stay on the execution of writs for nonpayment of rent. This order remained in effect through March 2022.

More detail on eviction protections in New Mexico can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/nm/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and beyond. We analyzed eviction records in Bernalillo County to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated quarterly.
