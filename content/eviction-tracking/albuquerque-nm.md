Eviction filings in Bernalillo County, NM (Albuquerque) have fallen sharply since March 2020. While eviction filings and hearings have been allowed to proceed, on March 24, 2020, the New Mexico Supreme Court implemented a stay on the execution of writs for nonpayment of rent. This order remains in effect until it is amended or withdrawn. 

More detail on eviction protections in New Mexico can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/nm/).
