While the state of Ohio has not instituted a general eviction moratorium, the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court halted the processing of non-emergency eviction filings as of March 16th. This policy has reduced filings to near zero since that date. The current policy is in effect until June 15th. 

More detail on eviction protections in Ohio can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/oh/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Cleveland is divided into 177 Census Tracts. Here we map, in each of those Tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see steep declines in eviction filings across the city.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2016.
