While the state of Ohio has not instituted a general eviction moratorium, the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court halted the processing of non-emergency eviction filings as of March 16, 2020. This policy reduced filings to near zero until its expiration on June 15, after which filings increased but generally remained below historical averages.

More detail on eviction protections in Ohio can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/oh/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Cleveland is divided into 177 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. By March, eviction filings dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, but have since increased closer to historical averages. Majority-Black neighborhoods continue to see the largest number of evictions. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2012–2016.<sup>1</sup>
