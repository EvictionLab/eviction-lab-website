While the state of Ohio did not institute a general eviction moratorium, the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court halted the processing of non-emergency eviction filings on March 16, 2020. This policy reduced filings to near zero until its expiration on June 15, 2020, after which filings increased. During the summer of 2020, Cleveland also extended the [right to counsel for many tenants facing eviction](https://freeevictionhelp.org/).

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2012–2016.<sup>1</sup>

1. Average eviction filings taken from Eviction Lab data for 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016
