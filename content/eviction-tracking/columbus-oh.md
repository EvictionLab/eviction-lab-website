While the state of Ohio did not institute a general eviction moratorium, the courts in Franklin County (Columbus) halted the processing of non-emergency eviction filings between March 16th and June 1st. To maintain social distancing, [court operations shifted to the Greater Columbus Convention Center since reopening.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/how-do-you-hold-housing-court-in-a-pandemic)

More detail on eviction protections in Ohio can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/oh/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Columbus is divided into 284 Census Tracts. Here we map, in each of those Tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see steep declines in many parts of the city, but a number of neighborhoods near the city center with above-average filings.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-White neighborhoods. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, but appear to be increasing more rapidly in majority-Black neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn–within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority–between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2016.
