While the state of Ohio did not institute a general eviction moratorium, the courts in Franklin County (Columbus) halted the processing of non-emergency eviction filings between March 16 and June 1, 2020. 

More detail on eviction protections in Ohio can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/oh/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Columbus were very close to historical averages in January and February of 2020.<sup>1</sup> Filings dropped dramatically in March but then increased closer toward historical averages. Notably, eviction filings were above average in December 2020 and March 2021.<sup>2</sup>

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Columbus to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Columbus is divided into 284 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-white neighborhoods. Eviction filings dropped across all neighborhoods by March and April, but have moderately increased in recent months. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn–within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority–between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in previous years.<sup>1</sup>
