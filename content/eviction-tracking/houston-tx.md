Eviction filings in Harris and Galveston Counties, TX (Houston) fell sharply once eviction proceedings were suspended across Texas on March 19, 2020. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2015), eviction filings were far below average over the last two weeks of March, and through April and May. Eviction protections in Texas began to expire on May 18, 2020. Courts in Harris County resumed business shortly thereafter, followed by the courts in Galveston County in early June.

More detail on eviction protections in Texas can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/tx/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Harris and Galveston counties are divided into 853 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. In March, eviction filings dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though they have increased closer to historical averages since then.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2012–2015. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-white neighborhoods were higher than average in the first three months of 2020.<sup>1</sup>
