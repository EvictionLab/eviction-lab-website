Eviction filings in the Las Vegas area (Clark County, NV) fell sharply by March 2020. The state of Nevada put in place a moratorium on eviction proceedings from late-March until mid-October 2020. After the expiration of these protections, eviction filings rose. The state then implemented a second moratorium in December 2020 for tenants who affirmed that they had been financially affected by COVID-19 or would be made homeless by eviction. Those protections expired at the end of May 2021. 

More detail on eviction protections in Nevada can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/nv/).
