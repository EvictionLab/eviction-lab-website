Eviction filings in Minneapolis-Saint Paul (Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, MN) fell sharply in mid-March 2020 when a statewide moratorium on evictions was put in place on March 16. The moratorium had been renewed each month until June 2021, after which the state [began phasing out protections](https://nlihc.org/resource/minnesotas-eviction-moratorium-ramp).

More detail on eviction protections in Minneapolis–Saint Paul can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mn/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Filings increased following the expiration of state protections.

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and beyond. We analyzed eviction records in Hennepin and Ramsey Counties to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

Eviction Hotspot data will be updated quarterly.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2012–2019.<sup>1</sup>
