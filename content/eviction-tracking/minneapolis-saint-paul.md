Eviction filings in Minneapolis-Saint Paul fell sharply in mid-March 2020 when a statewide moratorium on evictions was put in place on March 16. The moratorium was renewed each month until June 2021, after which the state [began phasing out protections](https://nlihc.org/resource/minnesotas-eviction-moratorium-ramp).

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2012–2019.<sup>1</sup>
