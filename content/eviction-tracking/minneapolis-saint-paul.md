Eviction filings in Minneapolis-Saint Paul (Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, MN) have fallen sharply since mid-March 2020 when a statewide-moratorium on evictions was put in place on March 16. The moratorium had been renewed each month until June 2021, after which the state began phasing out protections. Landlords are still restricted from filing for nonpayment of rent through mid-September. 

More detail on eviction protections in Minneapolis–Saint Paul can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mn/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in the Twin Cities were running below historical averages in January and February of 2020.<sup>1</sup> That pattern accelerated in March, and in May eviction filings in Hennepin and Ramsey Counties were 98% below average. Filings have increased very slightly since then, but remain well below historical averages.

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Hennepin and Ramsey Counties to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Hennepin and Ramsey Counties are divided into 436 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in the Twin Cities are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March 2020, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2012–2019.<sup>1</sup>
