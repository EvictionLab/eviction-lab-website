Eviction filings in Minneapolis-Saint Paul (Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, MN) have fallen sharply since mid-march when a statewide-moratorium on evictions was put in place on March 16th. The moratorium has continued to be renewed each month. Although filings were down in the single-digits throughout the summer months, they have begun to rise gradually in recent weeks.

More detail on eviction protections in Minneapolis–Saint Paul can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mn/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in the Twin Cities are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2019.
