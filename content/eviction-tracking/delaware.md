Delaware implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 17 and July 1, 2020. Almost no new eviction cases were filed in the state during this period. Since the moratorium lifted, new case filings have increased, but remain below normal levels.

More detail on eviction protections in Delaware can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/de/). A closer look at eviction filing patterns in Wilmington and the surrounding area is [available here](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/wilmington-de/).
