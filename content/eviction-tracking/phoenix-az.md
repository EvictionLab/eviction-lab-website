Eviction filings in Maricopa County, AZ (Phoenix) fell sharply in April 2020 and have remained below historical averages. The state of Arizona instituted an eviction moratorium in late-March, but this policy only suspended enforcement of COVID-19-related nonpayment evictions, and new filings were being accepted. These eviction protections in the state expired at the end of October.

This data, unlike most of the Eviction Tracking System, will only be updated on a monthly basis for Maricopa County. [New Orleans (Orleans Parish, LA) ](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/new-orleans-la/)and [Las Vegas (Clark County, NV)](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/las-vegas-nv/) are the other areas with monthly-only updates. 

More detail on eviction protections in Arizona can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/az/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Maricopa County is divided into 916 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Latinx, or Other/None. Between January and March 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-white neighborhoods. Since April, eviction filings have dropped across all neighborhoods, though they have increased back closer to historical averages in recent months. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2015-2019.<sup>1</sup>
