Eviction filings in Phoenix fell sharply in April 2020. The state of Arizona instituted an eviction moratorium in late-March 2020, but this policy only suspended enforcement of COVID-19-related nonpayment evictions, and new filings were being accepted. These eviction protections in the state expired at the end of October 2020.

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In this barplot, we show the distribution of eviction filings over the last year by neighborhood racial/ethnic majority.  

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2015-2019.<sup>1</sup>
