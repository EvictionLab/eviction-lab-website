Eviction filings in Maricopa County, AZ (Phoenix) have fallen sharply from April of this year onward. The state of Arizona instituted an eviction moratorium, but this policy only suspends enforcement of COVID-19-related nonpayment evictions, and new filings are being accepted. These eviction protections in the state expired at the end of October.

This data, unlike the rest of the Eviction Tracking System, will only be updated on a monthly basis for Maricopa County. 

More detail on eviction protections in Arizona can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/az/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Latinx, or Other/None. Between January and March, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-White neighborhoods. Since April, eviction filings have dropped  across all neighborhoods, and have been more evenly distributed between majority-White and majority-Latinx neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2015-2019.
