The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31, 2020. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period. Filings increased following the end of the moratorium.

Our state-wide counts of eviction filings are slight underestimates when compared to the official [Pennsylvania court data dashboard](https://www.pacourts.us/news-and-statistics/research-and-statistics/dashboard-table-of-contents/magisterial-district-courts-statewide-dashboard). 

More detail on eviction protections in Pennsylvania can be found on the COVID-19 [Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/pa/). Additional information is available on eviction filing patterns in [Pittsburgh ](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/pittsburgh-pa/)and [Philadelphia](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/philadelphia-pa/)

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Pennsylvania is divided into 67 counties. In each of those counties, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
