Eviction filings in Alachua County, FL (Gainesville) fell dramatically in April, and have remained below historical average since then. Florida has instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium, though the protections offered by that moratorium were reduced in August.

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/fl/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In early 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in majority-White neighborhoods. Since April, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2017–2019.
