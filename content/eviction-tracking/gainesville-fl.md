{{< report_intro site_id="12001" data="/uploads/table.csv" >}}

Eviction filings in Gainesville fell significantly below average when a state-wide eviction moratorium was instituted in April 2020. These eviction protections expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020.

Note: Data collection in Alachua County is currently on hold as we switch to a different data source.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2017–2019.<sup>1</sup>
