Eviction filings in Gainesville fell significantly below average when a state-wide eviction moratorium was instituted in April 2020. These eviction protections expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020.

In most locations that we track, we are able to access eviction filing records shortly after they are filed with the courts. In Gainesville, however, these records are only available with a delay. We update this page with the most recent data that we have available. The past month reported here is the most recent month for which we have data.

# The geography of eviction filings

Gainesville is divided into 56 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2017–2019.<sup>1</sup>
