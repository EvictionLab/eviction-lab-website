Eviction filings in Orleans Parish, LA (city of New Orleans) fell sharply in late-March 2020 and have remained below historical averages. The state of Louisiana instituted an eviction moratorium in March 2020, but those statewide protections expired in mid-June 2020. In August and September 2021, Hurricane Ida caused local courts to close and led Governor Edwards to halt court proceedings until September 24. 

More detail on eviction protections in Louisiana can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/la/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2019.<sup>1</sup>
