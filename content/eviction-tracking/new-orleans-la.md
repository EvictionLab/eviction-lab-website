# The geography of changes in eviction filings

New Orleans is divided into 177 census tracts. In most of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks.<sup>1</sup> If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>2</sup>

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In Orleans Parish, eviction filings have been concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2017–2019.<sup>1</sup>
