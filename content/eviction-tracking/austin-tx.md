Eviction filings in Travis County, TX (Austin) have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Texas on March 19, 2020. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2014-2019), eviction filings fell far below average beginning in April. Eviction protections in Texas began to expire on May 18, 2020. However, Travis County has local protections in place until the end of 2021, though some of those protections expired in the summer of 2021. 

More detail on eviction protections in Texas can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/tx/).

If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2014-2019.<sup>1</sup>
