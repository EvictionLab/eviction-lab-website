The state of Indiana implemented an eviction moratorium that ran from March 19 to August 14, 2020. Courts in Marion County (Indianapolis) have been accepting new eviction filings and processing cases since that moratorium lifted. 

More detail on eviction protections in Indianapolis can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/in/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Indianapolis ran above historical averages in January and February of 2020.<sup>1</sup> They began to drop in March and bottomed out near zero in April. Filings remained low during the moratorium period, but jumped immediately after it was lifted, though they still remain below historical averages.

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in Indianapolis to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Marion County is divided into 224 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in Indianapolis are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white or majority-Black. In March and April 2020, eviction filings dropped across all neighborhoods, though they have increased closer to historical averages since then. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
