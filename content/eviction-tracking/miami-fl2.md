Eviction filings in Miami-Ft. Lauderdale fell sharply in early 2020. Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July 2020. After the moratorium expired, execution of eviction orders was also delayed until October 1, 2020. 

In most locations that we track, we are able to access eviction filing records shortly after they are filed with the courts. In Miami-Ft. Lauderdale, however, these records are only available with a delay. We update this page with the most recent data that we have available. The past month reported here is the most recent month for which we have data.

# The geography of eviction filings

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties are divided into 1219 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>

1. Eviction filing data for Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties were collected by the \\\[Shimberg Center for Housing Studies](http://www.shimberg.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. Historical averages cover the years 2014-2019.
2. Tract-level breakdown of renter race/ethnicity determined using American Community Survey (ACS) estimates for 2015–2019.
3. We are unable to assign many cases from prior to 2020 in Miami-Dade County to a census tract due to missing street address information. As a result, the “Filings Relative to Average” tab in Miami-Dade County census tracts only reflects data in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2014–2019.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
