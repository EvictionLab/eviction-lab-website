The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31, 2020. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period, though courts did process previously-filed eviction cases. Eviction filings in Pittsburgh were down to nearly zero in April and May 2020, but increased by September 2020 following the end of the moratorium.
