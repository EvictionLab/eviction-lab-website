The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31st. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period, though courts did process previously-filed eviction cases. Eviction filings in Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) were down to nearly zero in April, May, and June, but increased markedly following the end of the moratorium. 

More detail on eviction protections in Pennsylvania can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/pa/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-white neighborhoods. From March onwards, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2019.
