The state of Pennsylvania enacted a strong eviction moratorium that extended until August 31, 2020. Eviction filings related to nonpayment of rent were not accepted during that period, though courts did process previously-filed eviction cases. Eviction filings in Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) were down to nearly zero in April and May, but increased markedly by September following the end of the moratorium. 

More detail on eviction protections in Pennsylvania can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/pa/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-white neighborhoods. Starting in March, eviction filings dropped across all neighborhoods, though they increased back closer to historical averages by September. Majority-white neighborhoods continue to see the largest number of eviction filings. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2012–2019.<sup>1</sup>
