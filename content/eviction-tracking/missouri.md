{{< report_intro site_id="29" data="/uploads/states_table.csv" >}}



Missouri never implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium, though a number of counties did establish protections for renters. Filings fell early in the pandemic, but increased steadily over the course of 2020.

In most locations that we track, we are able to access eviction filing records shortly after they are filed with the courts. In Missouri, however, these records are only available with a delay. We update this page with the most recent data that we have available. The past month reported here is the most recent month for which we have data.

Additional information is available on eviction filing patterns in [St. Louis](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/st-louis-mo/) and [Kansas City](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/kansas-city-mo/).

# The geography of eviction filings

Missouri is divided into 115 counties and county-equivalents. In each, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
