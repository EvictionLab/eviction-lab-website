Missouri never implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium, though a number of counties did establish protections for renters. Filings fell early in the pandemic, but increased steadily over the course of 2020.

More detail on eviction protections in Indiana can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mo/). Additional information is available on eviction filing patterns in [St. Louis](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/st-louis-mo/) and [Kansas City](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/kansas-city-mo/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Missouri is divided into 115 counties and county-equivalents. In each, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup>
