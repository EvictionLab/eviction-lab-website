Missouri never implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium, though a number of counties did establish protections for renters. Filings fell early in the pandemic, but increased steadily over the course of 2020.

More detail on eviction protections in Indiana can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mo/). Additional information is available on eviction filing patterns in [St. Louis](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/st-louis-mo/) and [Kansas City](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/kansas-city-mo/).
