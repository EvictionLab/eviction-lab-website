Delaware implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 17 and July 1, 2020. Almost no new eviction cases were filed in New Castle County (Wilmington and the surrounding areas) during this period. Since the moratorium lifted, however, new case filings have increased, but remain below historical averages.

More detail on eviction protections in Delaware can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/de/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

New Castle County is divided into 131 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, most evictions in New Castle County are filed in neighborhoods that are majority-white. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2016–2019.
