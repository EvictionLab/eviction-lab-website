Delaware implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 17 and July 1, 2020. Almost no new eviction cases were filed in New Castle County (Wilmington and the surrounding areas) during this period. After the moratorium lifted, however, new case filings increased.

More detail on eviction protections in Delaware can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/de/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2022 and average filings in 2016–2019.<sup>1</sup>
