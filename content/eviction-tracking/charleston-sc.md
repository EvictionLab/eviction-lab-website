South Carolina implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 17 and May 14, 2020. In both Charleston and [Greenville](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/greenville-sc/), this period saw almost no new eviction filings. Since the moratorium lifted, however, new case filings have increased.

More detail on eviction protections in South Carolina can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/sc/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Charleston County is divided into 86 Census Tracts. In each of those Tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. Under normal circumstances, evictions in Charleston are filed relatively evenly in neighborhoods that are majority-white and majority-Black. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though appear to have increased most in majority-Black neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2016–2019.
