# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Jacksonville is divided into 174 Census Tracts. Here we map, in each of those Tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see steep declines in eviction filings across the city.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Other/None categories. Since April, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2015.
