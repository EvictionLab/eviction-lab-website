Eviction filings in Duval County (Jacksonville) fell sharply in April 2020. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2016), eviction filings were down 95% or more in April through July 2020. 

Florida instituted a state-wide eviction moratorium which expired at the end of July, after which eviction filings increased. Execution of eviction orders was also delayed until no earlier than October 1, 2020.

More detail on eviction protections in Florida can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/fl/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Jacksonville were higher than average in January and February 2020.<sup>1</sup> That pattern reversed in March. Less than 50 cases were filed in both April and May. Filings increased by August following the expiration of the state-wide eviction moratorium and have generally remained close to or just below historical averages.<sup>2</sup>

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Jacksonville is divided into 174 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January 2020, eviction filings were most concentrated in neighborhoods in the Other/None categories. By April, eviction filings dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though they have since increased back closer to historical averages. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in 2012–2016.<sup>1</sup>
