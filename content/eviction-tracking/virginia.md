Virginia implemented a state-wide eviction moratorium between March 16, 2020 and June 28, 2020. Further protections restricting the circumstances under which evictions could be filed were in place from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021, and were renewed from August 10, 2021 to June 30, 2022. Eviction filings remained low in the state during these periods, but have increased since these protections were lifted.

More detail on eviction protections in Virginia can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/va/). A closer look at eviction filing patterns in Richmond and the surrounding area is [available here](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/richmond-va/).

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Virginia is divided into 134 counties and jurisdictions. In 124 of these, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the county—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
