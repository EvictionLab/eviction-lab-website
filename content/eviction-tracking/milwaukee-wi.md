Eviction filings in Milwaukee, WI fell sharply once Governor Tony Evers blocked the initiation of non-emergency eviction proceedings on March 27, 2020. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2016), eviction filings were far below average in March, April, and May 2020. Eviction protections in Wisconsin began to expire on May 26, 2020, after which filings increased.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Milwaukee is made up of 298 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last year. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# The demographics of eviction filings

**Eviction filings by neighborhood race/ethnicity**

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings over the last year and average filings in 2012–2016.<sup>1</sup>
