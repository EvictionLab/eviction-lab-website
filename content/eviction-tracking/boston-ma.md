Eviction filings in Boston, MA have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Massachusetts on March 17. A subsequent moratorium halted evictions through mid-October. However, law enforcement cannot carry out eviction orders in Somerville until further notice. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2013, 2015–2016), eviction filings fell far below average beginning in April 2020, though filings rose modestly in November after the state moratorium expired.

The City of Boston enacted new protections in late-August 2021, prohibiting landlords and owners from serving or enforcing residential evictions, except in cases of serious lease violations or health and safety issues. 

More detail on eviction protections in Massachusetts can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/ma/).

1. Boston eviction filing data has a disproportionate number of cases with missing census tract information in recent months. We have temporarily pulled our tract-level analyses as a result.
