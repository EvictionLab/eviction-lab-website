While the state of Missouri has not enacted any protections for renters, the 22nd Judicial Circuit (City of St. Louis) did suspend eviction proceedings in mid-March through July 22, 2020. Eviction filings in St. Louis declined precipitously in April, May and June before picking up again in July. The execution of certain types of eviction orders in St. Louis City is suspended until October 3, 2021. Execution of eviction orders in St. Louis County was suspended, under certain conditions, until June 30, 2021.

More detail on eviction protections in Missouri can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mo/).

# Eviction Hotspots

Eviction filings aren’t spread evenly across cities: a small number of buildings are responsible for a disproportionate share of eviction cases. This pattern, [which existed before the pandemic](https://evictionlab.org/top-evicting-landlords-drive-us-eviction-crisis/), has continued in 2020 and 2021. We analyzed eviction records in St. Louis to determine where the most cases are being filed during the pandemic. This is a list of eviction hot spots—the 10 buildings responsible for the most filings—over the course of the full pandemic and over the last eight weeks. We also display the plaintiff name most often listed with a given building in the court filings.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

St. Louis is made up of 305 census tracts. In each of those tracts, we map the number of eviction filings over the last four weeks. If you toggle below you can see these numbers as eviction filing rates—the number of eviction filings divided by the number of renter households in the area—or compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February 2020, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. In March and April, eviction filings dropped steeply across all neighborhoods, though they have more recently increased slightly closer to historical averages. 

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020-2021 and average filings in previous years. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-Black neighborhoods were higher than average in the first two months of 2020.<sup>1</sup>
