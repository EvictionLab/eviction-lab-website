# The geography of changes in eviction filings

St. Louis is made up of 305 Census Tracts. In each of those Tracts, we map eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see steep declines in eviction filings across nearly the entire city.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2016. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-Black neighborhoods were higher than average in the first three months of 2020.
