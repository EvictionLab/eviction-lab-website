Since eviction records do not include demographic information like age or gender, we do not have direct access to these numbers. However, Eviction Lab’s researchers have [published studies](https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-7/december/SocSci_v7_649to662.pdf) that show that Black and Latinx female renters face higher eviction filing rates than their male counterparts. Black and Latinx renters are also more likely to be serially filed against for eviction at the same address.

There are also [local studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16300977) show that households with children are especially vulnerable to forced displacement. While we don’t have the full picture now, the Eviction Lab dataset enables users to create estimates on a scale that was previously impossible, and important questions like these can be addressed in future research.
