Eviction records do not include demographic information like age or gender, but thanks to a collaboration with the U.S. Census Bureau, Eviction Lab has been able to estimate the number of renters experiencing eviction each year while also revealing—for the first time—a demographic profile of those renters. Our joint research includes information on the gender, age and race/ethnicity of people affected eviction. You can read more about this research [here](https://evictionlab.org/who-is-evicted-in-america/).

Among our findings, we can say that 2.9 million children under age 18 are threatened with eviction, and 1.5 million are issued an eviction judgment, each year.

We also know that around one in every nine renters threatened with eviction every year—almost 830,000 people—are over the age of 50. Nearly 170,000 seniors age 65+ face the threat of eviction every year.

Black renters face a disproportionate share of evictions. Less than one in every five renters in America is Black, but over half of all eviction filings are against Black renters.

Previous work has shown that women are at a higher risk of eviction than men. There is a significant gender disparity in terms of the disproportionate listing of Black women on eviction filings compared to Black men, especially in households with children.

Other [published studies](https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-7/december/SocSci_v7_649to662.pdf) show that Black and Latinx female renters face higher eviction filing rates than their male counterparts. Black and Latinx renters, in general, are more likely to be serially filed against for eviction at the same address.

There are also [local studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16300977) that show that households with children are especially vulnerable to forced displacement.
