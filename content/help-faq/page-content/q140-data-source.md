The Modeled Estimates in our National Map incorporate over 99.9 million records related to eviction gathered from a variety of sources. The lab directly collected court records from states and counties, but for many states getting this data was difficult because they did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information.  In some cases, researchers outside of the lab helped us get records or aggregate filings counts. The Lab also purchased comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from LexisNexis Risk Solutions and American Information Research Services Inc.
