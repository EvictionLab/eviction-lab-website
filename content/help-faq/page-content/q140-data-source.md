We have accumulated 99.9 million records related to eviction. The Eviction Lab directly collected court records from 19 states and 8 additional counties. There were also some instances in which researchers outside the EL helped us obtain court records or aggregate filing counts in specific locations. We wish to acknowledge and thank: researchers at Flatland for Wyandotte and Johnson Counties in Kansas; Jonathan Pyle for Pennsylvania and Philadelphia County; Ben Schofield for Virginia; Tim Thomas for Washington, Kevin Fagan for San Francisco, and Kyle Nelson for California.

But many states either did not centralize their eviction data or were unwilling to release this information. Accordingly, the Eviction Lab then purchased more comprehensive datasets of public eviction records from two companies: LexisNexis Risk Solutions and American Information Research Services Inc.
