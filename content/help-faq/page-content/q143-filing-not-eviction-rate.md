If you are looking at our Proprietary Map—our original database—you might notice that Arkansas, North Dakota, Alaska, and South Dakota do not have an eviction rate. These are states for which we do not have enough individual-level eviction records to establish the eviction rate with confidence. In these states, we can display reported statistics about eviction filings, however. For more details about how we handled data from different sources see our [Methods page](https://evictionlab.org/methods).

Users interested in the data for these states can look at our modeled data, which does provide estimates for those locations that do not share eviction data directly. These estimates have an uncertainty level that is presented as minimum and maximum values, which our models suggest are 95% certain to contain the true number.
