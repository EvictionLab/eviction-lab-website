An eviction happens when a landlord expels people from property he or she owns. Evictions are landlord-initiated involuntary moves that happen to renters, whereas foreclosures are involuntary moves that happen to homeowners when a bank or other lending agency repossesses a home.

An eviction process consists of several steps, from the moment of the eviction notice to the execution of the eviction.

GRAPHIC DESCRIBING AN EVICTION STEP BY STEPÂ 

In our data, an eviction is defined as an eviction judgment issued to a renting home. If a renter at the same address has multiple eviction judgments, we only count the last one. If the records indicated that the same household received multiple eviction judgments, we only counted the last one. This is because a household can be filed against multiple times over the course of a year but not evicted multiple times from the same address.
