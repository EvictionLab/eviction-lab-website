We’ve collected over 99.9 million eviction records going back several years, but we still don’t have them all! To solve this problem, we have created estimates in counties where we lack data, which are created using a model. These estimates have an uncertainty level that is presented as minimum and maximum values, which our models suggest are 95% certain to contain the true number.

We will continue our effort to provide the most comprehensive data on evictions in America and invite you to stay tuned for updates to our dataset by [signing up for our email list](https://evictionlab.org/help-faq/#mc_embed_signup). If we don’t have eviction numbers for your community, you could help by contacting your mayor or county clerk, requesting this information. If you have eviction data we don’t, consider sharing it by writing us at [research@evictionlab.org](mailto:research@evictionlab.org).
