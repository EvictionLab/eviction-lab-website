An eviction rate is the number of evictions per 100 renter homes in an area. An eviction rate of 5% means that 5 evictions were filed for every 100 renter homes in the selected area that year.

Information on the number of renter homes in an area comes from the U.S. Census and ESRI Business Analyst demographic estimates. We interpolate between 2000 and 2010 Census years for renting households to calculate yearly estimates for all geographies. For 2011-2016 and 2016-2018 estimates, we interpolate between 2010 Census counts and 2016 ESRI Business Analyst demographic estimates (see the [Methodology Report](https://evictionlab.org/docs/Eviction_Lab_Methodology_Report_2022.pdf)).
