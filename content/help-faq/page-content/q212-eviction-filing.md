An eviction filing is the result of a landlord filing a case in court to have a tenant removed from a property.

Within our data, case information is recorded as separate actions with dates of each action. Our estimate of eviction filings is the total amount of cases each year with a first recorded action in that year.

Over the course of a year, a landlord may file multiple evictions against the same household. We count each eviction filing when calculating the eviction filing number and rate.
