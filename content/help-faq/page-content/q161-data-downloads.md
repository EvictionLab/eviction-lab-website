Our primary data were collected manually from courts across the country. We also collected proprietary data from private vendors (see ABOUT THE DATA below). Because some areas are missing data over time in the courts and/or proprietary data, we used statistical models to “fill in the gaps” with modeled estimates. You can perform statistical analysis on the court data and the proprietary data but NOT on the modeled estimates. For more details, see our [methodological report]('/methods').
