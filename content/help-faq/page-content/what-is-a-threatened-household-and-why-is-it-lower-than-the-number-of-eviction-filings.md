An eviction filing does not necessarily mean that the threatened household leaves its home. A common practice is what is known as “serial filing,” where a landlord issues a series of eviction filings against a single household. 

We can use information in our case records to identify when a household receives multiple eviction filings in a given year. By counting the number of households who ever received a filing in a given year, we can calculate the households threatened rate. The eviction filing rate will always be higher than the households threatened rate.
