On the original map, we have indicated with the symbol <img class="hint" src="/images/icons/hint-icon.png" /> states with underestimated eviction counts. Of course, some places have low eviction rates because there are few renters living there or because there are very few evictions. But some states and the District of Columbia have underestimated eviction counts in our dataset for a variety of reasons.

Because coverage within our dataset is dependent on the area and year, it is possible for a single county to have fluctuations in data collection over time. As explained in our [Methodology Report](https://evictionlab.org/docs/Eviction_Lab_Methodology_Report_2022.pdf), we have flagged counties and embedded geographies (e.g., census tracts, block groups) with low eviction estimates. However, since we validated our data at the county level, counts of eviction filings at the level of census tracts and block groups that make up a low-estimate county might not in fact be undercounted. Our original data downloaded from the Get the Data page will contain these flags.

Here is a list of known issues with data collection at the state level, which have been flagged on our Original Data map:

In New York, records are often kept as “abstracted judgments,” which means they are only in the public record if the plaintiff/landlord pays to have them placed there. That plus the amount of town and village courts in the state makes collection difficult.

In California, many cases that end in eviction are sealed and therefore not accessible by the general public. In addition, it can be difficult to collect data from California as a whole, owing to restrictions on the number of records one can collect.

In most jurisdictions, the eviction process starts with an out-of-court notice delivered to a tenant, but in Maryland the process begins with an eviction filed in court. This means Maryland has a very high case volume. Because of that, it is difficult to collect data from Maryland, with the exception of Prince George’s county where we have consistency in case volume over time.

In New Jersey, while the number of eviction cases was collected reliably, information about the outcomes of those cases were not readily accessible. As a result, we believe our eviction rate is an underestimate.

In Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas, there is good data coverage in the urban centers, but there are some more rural areas that are missing data, owing to collection difficulties. Additionally, due to a collection anomaly in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, possession-only judgments may be under-reported in this jurisdiction in 2016.

You can compare eviction rates from our map and raw data with court-reported statistics on eviction filings from 28 states and the District of Columbia ([download court-reported statistics](https://data-downloads.evictionlab.org/court-reported-stats/ExtStatsFull.xlsx)). These statistics provide annual counts of evictions filed in counties up to 2016. To keep things consistent, we haven’t included these statistics in our map of evictions, but you can use them to help validate the original data.

The court-reported statistics show that Hawaii, Vermont, Connecticut, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia have low counts in our original map and data, owing either to the remoteness of some areas or data collection difficulties.

We also suspect that the numbers in Arizona, Idaho, New Hampshire, and Washington may be too low, based on an estimator we created that factors in things like the number of renter homes and caseloads in other places.

We will continue our effort to provide the most comprehensive data on evictions in America and invite you to stay tuned for updates to our dataset by [signing up for our email list](https://evictionlab.org/help-faq/#mc_embed_signup).
