    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified America's affordable housing and eviction crises. Even before its onset, millions struggled to make rent and were vulnerable to eviction. Now—at a time when stable shelter is most critical—unemployment and economic hardship have spiked to unprecedented levels, and the need to provide support and data to inform policy solutions is greater than ever.</p>
    <p>The Eviction Lab has responded by creating several new tools: The Eviction Tracking System, which provides weekly updates on eviction filings in a number of American cities; The COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard, which compiles and rates state-level protections during the pandemic; and a regularly-updated list of emergency policies across all levels of government. Lastly, for those who need direct help with housing, our site Just Shelter offers a database of resources in all 50 states that provide housing assistance, legal aid, and more.</p>
    <p>See below to explore our tools and resources.</p>

    <p>To prevent the deleterious health consequences of eviction and an escalating economic crisis, states are beginning to pursue strategies to ensure safe, decent, and stable housing during and after the pandemic.</p>
    <p>To better understand the steps states have taken to prevent homelessness during and after the pandemic, the Eviction Lab and Columbia Law School’s Professor Emily Benfer have developed a policy scorecard for each state, distilling the contents of thousands of newly-released emergency orders, declarations, and legislation into a clear set of critical measures included in, and left out of, state-level pandemic responses related to eviction and housing.</p>
