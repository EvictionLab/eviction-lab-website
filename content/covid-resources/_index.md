    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new urgency to America's affordable housing and eviction crises. Even before the pandemic, millions of families struggled to make rent and were vulnerable to eviction. Now—at a time when stable shelter is critical—spiking unemployment and economic hardship have increased insecurity among America’s renting families.</p>

    <p>The Eviction Lab has responded by partnering with housing law experts to create several new tools. The Eviction Tracking System provides weekly updates on eviction filings in a number of American cities.  The COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard compiles and rates state-level protections during the pandemic. A regularly-updated list of emergency policies across all levels of government allows you to see how elected officials in your community have responded. Last, for those who need direct help, JustShelter.org offers a database of resources in all 50 states that provide housing assistance, legal aid, and more.</p>
