Eviction filings in Boston, MA have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Massachusetts on March 17. A subsequent moratorium halts evictions through mid-August. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2016), eviction filings were far below average over the last two weeks of March and throughout April and May.

More detail on eviction protections in Massachusetts can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/ma/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in non-Latinx neighborhoods. In April and May, eviction filings dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in previous years.
