Eviction filings in St. Louis have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Missouri on March 19. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2015), eviction filings were far below average over the last two weeks of March and throughout April. Eviction protections in Texas begin to expire on May 18.

More detail on eviction protections in Missouri can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/mo/).

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. In March and through April, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2015. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-White neighborhoods were higher than average in the first three months of 2020.
