A number of other groups and organizations have, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, produced systems to track eviction filings in real-time. 

- The Open Justice Oklahoma has developed the [Oklahoma Court Tracker](https://openjusticeok.shinyapps.io/ok-court-tracker/#section-tool-by-open-justice-oklahoma), which counts evictions and foreclosures filed across the state of Oklahoma since March 15th, 2020.
- Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s CREATE Lab is [monitoring eviction filings in Pittsburgh, PA](http://evict-response.earthtime.org/). 
- The Eviction Solidarity Network in Austin, TX has built a dashboard to track eviction filings in Travis County.
