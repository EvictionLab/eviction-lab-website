Eviction filings in Travis County, TX (Austin) have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Texas on March 19. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2014-2019), eviction filings were far below average in April and May. Eviction protections in Texas began to expire on May 18.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Travis County is divided into 64 zip codes. Here we map, in each of those zip codes, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in 2012. Over that period, we see steep declines in eviction filings across the city.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and filings in 2012.
