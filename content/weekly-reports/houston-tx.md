Eviction filings in Harris County, TX (Houston) have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Texas on March 19. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2015), eviction filings were far below average over the last two weeks of March, in April, and through the first half of May. Eviction protections in Texas begin to expire on May 18.

More detail on eviction protections in Texas can be found on the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/tx/).

# Changes in eviction filings

Eviction filings in Houston were higher than average in January and February of this year.<sup>1</sup> That pattern reversed in March following the suspension of eviction proceedings. Eviction filings in April were well below average, a pattern that has continued in May. In a normal April, more than 3,000 evictions are filed in Houston. This year, fewer than 500 were filed.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Houston is divided into 786 Census Tracts. Here we map, in each of those Tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> Over that period, we see declines in eviction filings across the city, though also a number of neighborhoods with above-average filing levels.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. Since March, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2015. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-White neighborhoods were higher than average in the first three months of 2020.
