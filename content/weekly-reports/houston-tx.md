Eviction filings in Harris County, TX (Houston) have fallen sharply since eviction proceedings were suspended across Texas on March 19. Compared to equivalent periods in previous years (2012–2015), eviction filings were far below average over the last two weeks of March and throughout April. Eviction protections in Texas begin to expire on May 18.

# The geography of changes in eviction filings

Houston is divided into 783 Census Tracts. Here we map, in each of those Tracts, eviction filings over the last four weeks compared to the typical number of filings in the average year.<sup>1</sup> As of the end of April, we see steep declines in eviction filings across the city.

# Eviction filings by neighborhood demographics

American Community Survey (ACS) data allow us to categorize neighborhoods by their racial/ethnic majority: White, Black, Latinx, or Other/None. In January and February, eviction filings were concentrated in neighborhoods in the Latinx and Other/None categories. In March and through April, eviction filings have dropped steeply across all neighborhoods.

When you toggle the figure to see data relative to average, comparisons are being drawn—within the same set of neighborhoods defined by racial/ethnic majority—between filings in 2020 and average filings in 2012–2015. This allows us to see, for example, that filings in majority-White neighborhoods were higher than average in the first three months of 2020.
