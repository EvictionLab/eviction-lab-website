Over 1.6 million American households are evicted from their homes each year. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to severely worsen this ongoing housing crisis. Unprecedented spikes in unemployment leave an increasing number of households unable to pay rent. The nation’s most severe public health emergency in a century may cause large spikes in eviction, displacement, and homelessness. This, in turn, will only deepen the current public health challenge. Ensuring housing security is vital to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and sustaining health, economic security, and family stability.

Current policy responses to the pandemic may be insufficient to prevent a surge in evictions. CARES Act stimulus payments and unemployment insurance—when accessible—will provide families with some support, but in many cases not enough to make ends meet. Some states and localities have passed temporary eviction moratoria, which are tracked in the [COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard](https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/). Once lifted, however, millions of renters and homeowners will owe significant amounts of back rent. For many, a displacement and eviction crisis will follow the public health crisis.

There is currently no data infrastructure that allows policymakers, legal and advocacy organizations, journalists, academics, and community members to track displacement and evictions in real time. The Eviction Lab has built the Eviction Tracking System (ETS) to fill this critical gap and to help monitor and respond to eviction hotspots as they emerge. The ETS is designed as a multi-site, open-source, and expandable system for tracking eviction filings as they happen.

Scroll down to see the list of cities in which we are operating. We welcome feedback, as well as partnerships with states and localities who wish to work with us in monitoring and responding to emerging eviction hotspots.
